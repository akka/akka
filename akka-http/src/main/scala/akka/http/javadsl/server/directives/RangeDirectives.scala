   * Answers GET requests with an `Accept-Ranges: bytes` header and converts HttpResponses coming back from its inner
   * route into partial responses if the initial request contained a valid `Range` request header. The requested
   * byte-ranges may be coalesced.
   * This directive is transparent to non-GET requests
   * Rejects requests with unsatisfiable ranges `UnsatisfiableRangeRejection`.
   * Rejects requests with too many expected ranges.
   *
   * Note: if you want to combine this directive with `conditional(...)` you need to put
   * it on the *inside* of the `conditional(...)` directive, i.e. `conditional(...)` must be
   * on a higher level in your route structure in order to function correctly.

/**
 * Java API: Test kit for testing actors. Inheriting from this class enables
 * reception of replies from actors, which are queued by an internal actor and
 * can be examined using the `expectMsg...` methods. Assertions and
 * bounds concerning timing are available in the form of `Within`
 * blocks.
 *
 * Beware of two points:
 *
 *  - the ActorSystem passed into the constructor needs to be shutdown,
 *    otherwise thread pools and memory will be leaked - this trait is not
 *    thread-safe (only one actor with one queue, one stack of `Within`
 *    blocks); take care not to run tests within a single test class instance in
 *    parallel.
 *
 *  - It should be noted that for CI servers and the like all maximum Durations
 *    are scaled using the `dilated` method, which uses the
 *    TestKitExtension.Settings.TestTimeFactor settable via akka.conf entry
 *    "akka.test.timefactor".

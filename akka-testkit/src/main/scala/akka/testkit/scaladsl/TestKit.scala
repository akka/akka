/**
 * Test kit for testing actors. Inheriting from this class enables reception of
 * replies from actors, which are queued by an internal actor and can be
 * examined using the `expectMsg...` methods. Assertions and bounds concerning
 * timing are available in the form of `within` blocks.
 *
 * {{{
 * class Test extends TestKit(ActorSystem()) {
 *   try {
 *
 *     val test = system.actorOf(Props[SomeActor])
 *
 *       within (1.second) {
 *         test ! SomeWork
 *         expectMsg(Result1) // bounded to 1 second
 *         expectMsg(Result2) // bounded to the remainder of the 1 second
 *       }
 *
 *     } finally {
 *       system.terminate()
 *     }
 *
 *   } finally {
 *     system.terminate()
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * Beware of two points:
 *
 *  - the ActorSystem passed into the constructor needs to be shutdown,
 *    otherwise thread pools and memory will be leaked
 *  - this class is not thread-safe (only one actor with one queue, one stack
 *    of `within` blocks); it is expected that the code is executed from a
 *    constructor as shown above, which makes this a non-issue, otherwise take
 *    care not to run tests within a single test class instance in parallel.
 *
 * It should be noted that for CI servers and the like all maximum Durations
 * are scaled using their Duration.dilated method, which uses the
 * TestKitExtension.Settings.TestTimeFactor settable via akka.conf entry "akka.test.timefactor".

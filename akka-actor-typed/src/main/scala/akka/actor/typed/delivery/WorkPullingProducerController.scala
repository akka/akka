/**
 * Work pulling is a pattern where several worker actors pull tasks in their own pace from
 * a shared work manager instead of that the manager pushes work to the workers blindly
 * without knowing their individual capacity and current availability.
 *
 * The `WorkPullingProducerController` can be used together with [[ConsumerController]] to
 * implement the work pulling pattern.
 *
 * One important property is that the order of the messages should not matter, because each
 * message is routed randomly to one of the workers with demand. In other words, two subsequent
 * messages may be routed to two different workers and processed independent of each other.
 *
 * A worker actor (consumer) and its `ConsumerController` is dynamically registered to the
 * `WorkPullingProducerController` via a [[ServiceKey]]. It will register itself to the
 * * [[akka.actor.typed.receptionist.Receptionist]], and the `WorkPullingProducerController`
 * subscribes to the same key to find active workers. In this way workers can be dynamically
 * added or removed from any node in the cluster.
 *
 * The work manager (producer) actor will start the flow by sending a [[WorkPullingProducerController.Start]]
 * message to the `WorkPullingProducerController`. The `ActorRef` in the `Start` message is
 * typically constructed as a message adapter to map the [[WorkPullingProducerController.RequestNext]]
 * to the protocol of the producer actor.
 *
 * The `WorkPullingProducerController` sends `RequestNext` to the producer, which is then allowed
 * to send one message to the `WorkPullingProducerController` via the `sendNextTo` in the `RequestNext`.
 * Thereafter the producer will receive a new `RequestNext` when it's allowed to send one more message.
 * It will send a new `RequestNext` when there are demand from any worker.
 * It's possible that all workers with demand are deregistered after the `RequestNext` is sent and before
 * the actual messages is sent to the `WorkPullingProducerController`. In that case the message is
 * buffered and will be delivered when a new worker is registered or when there is new demand.
 *
 * The producer and `WorkPullingProducerController` actors are supposed to be local so that these messages are
 * fast and not lost. This is enforced by a runtime check.
 *
 * Many unconfirmed messages can be in flight between the `WorkPullingProducerController` and each
 * `ConsumerController`. The flow control is driven by the consumer side, which means that the
 * `WorkPullingProducerController` will not send faster than the demand requested by the workers.
 *
 * Lost messages are detected, resent and deduplicated if needed. This is also driven by the consumer side,
 * which means that the `WorkPullingProducerController` will not push resends unless requested by the
 * `ConsumerController`.
 *
 * If a worker crashes or is stopped gracefully the unconfirmed messages for that worker will be
 * routed to other workers by the `WorkPullingProducerController`. This may result in that some messages
 * may be processed more than once, by different workers.
 *
 * Until sent messages have been confirmed the `WorkPullingProducerController` keeps them in memory to be able to
 * resend them. If the JVM of the `WorkPullingProducerController` crashes those unconfirmed messages are lost.
 * To make sure the messages can be delivered also in that scenario the `WorkPullingProducerController` can be
 * used with a [[DurableProducerQueue]]. Then the unconfirmed messages are stored in a durable way so
 * that they can be redelivered when the producer is started again. An implementation of the
 * `DurableProducerQueue` is provided by `EventSourcedProducerQueue` in `akka-persistence-typed`.
 *
 * Instead of using `tell` with the `sendNextTo` in the `RequestNext` the producer can use `context.ask`
 * with the `askNextTo` in the `RequestNext`. The difference is that a reply is sent back when the
 * message has been handled. If a `DurableProducerQueue` is used then the reply is sent when the message
 * has been stored successfully, but it might not have been processed by the consumer yet. Otherwise the
 * reply is sent after the consumer has processed and confirmed the message.
 *
 * It's also possible to use the `WorkPullingProducerController` and `ConsumerController` without resending
 * lost messages, but the flow control is still used. This can for example be useful when both consumer and
 * producer are know to be located in the same local `ActorSystem`. This can be more efficient since messages
 * don't have to be kept in memory in the `ProducerController` until they have been
 * confirmed, but the drawback is that lost messages will not be delivered. See configuration
 * `only-flow-control` of the `ConsumerController`.
 *
 * The `producerId` is used in logging and included as MDC entry with key `"producerId"`. It's propagated
 * to the `ConsumerController` and is useful for correlating log messages. It can be any `String` but it's
 * recommended to use a unique identifier of representing the producer.
 *
 * If the `DurableProducerQueue` is defined it is created as a child actor of the `WorkPullingProducerController` actor.
 * `ProducerController` actors are created for each registered worker. Those child actors use the same dispatcher
 * as the parent `WorkPullingProducerController`.

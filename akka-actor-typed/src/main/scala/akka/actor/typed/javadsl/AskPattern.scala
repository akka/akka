/**
 * The ask-pattern implements the initiator side of a request–reply protocol.
 *
 * Note that if you are inside of an actor you should prefer [[ActorContext.ask]]
 * as that provides better safety.
 *
 * The party that asks may be within or without an Actor, since the
 * implementation will fabricate a (hidden) [[ActorRef]] that is bound to a
 * `CompletableFuture`. This ActorRef will need to be injected in the
 * message that is sent to the target Actor in order to function as a reply-to
 * address, therefore the argument to the ask method is not the message itself
 * but a function that given the reply-to address will create the message.

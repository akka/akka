/**
 * An actor `Behavior` can be implemented by extending this class and implement the
 * abstract method [[AbstractBehavior#createReceive]]. Mutable state can be defined
 * as instance variables of the class.
 *
 * This is an Object-oriented style of defining a `Behavior`. A more functional style
 * alternative is provided by the factory methods in [[Behaviors]], for example
 * [[Behaviors.receiveMessage]].
 *
 * Instances of this behavior should be created via [[Behaviors.setup]] and
 * the [[ActorContext]] should be passed as a constructor parameter
 * from the factory function. This is important because a new instance
 * should be created when restart supervision is used.
 *
 * When switching `Behavior` to another `AbstractBehavior` the original `ActorContext`
 * can be used as the `context` parameter instead of wrapping in a new `Behaviors.setup`,
 * but it wouldn't be wrong to use `context` from `Behaviors.setup` since that is the same
 * `ActorContext` instance.
 *
 * It must not be created with an `ActorContext` of another actor, such as the parent actor.
 * Such mistake will be detected at runtime and throw `IllegalStateException` when the
 * first message is received.
 *
 * @see [[Behaviors.setup]]

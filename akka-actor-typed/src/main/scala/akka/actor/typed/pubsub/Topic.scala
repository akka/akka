/**
 * A pub sub topic is an actor that handles subscribing to a topic and publishing messages to all subscribed actors.
 *
 * It is mostly useful in a clustered setting, where it is intended to be started once on every node that want to
 * house subscribers or publish messages to the topic, but it also works in a local setting without cluster.
 *
 * In a clustered context messages are deduplicated so that there is at most one message sent to each node for
 * each publish and if there are no subscribers on a node, no message is sent to it. Note that the list of subscribers
 * is eventually consistent and there are no delivery guarantees built in.
 *
 * Each topic results in a [[akka.actor.typed.receptionist.ServiceKey]] in the [[akka.actor.typed.receptionist.Receptionist]]
 * so the same scaling recommendation holds for topics, see docs:
 * https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actor-discovery.html#receptionist-scalability

/**
 * A message protocol for actors that support spawning a child actor when receiving a [[SpawnProtocol#Spawn]]
 * message and sending back the [[ActorRef]] of the child actor. Create instances through the [[SpawnProtocol#apply]]
 * or [[SpawnProtocol#create]] factory methods.
 *
 * The typical usage of this is to use it as the guardian actor of the [[ActorSystem]], possibly combined with
 * `Behaviors.setup` to starts some initial tasks or actors. Child actors can then be started from the outside
 * by telling or asking [[SpawnProtocol#Spawn]] to the actor reference of the system. When using `ask` this is
 * similar to how [[akka.actor.ActorSystem#actorOf]] can be used in classic actors with the difference that
 * a `Future` / `CompletionStage` of the `ActorRef` is returned.
 *
 * Stopping children is done through specific support in the protocol of the children, or stopping the entire
 * spawn protocol actor.

   *
   * If the `name` is already taken of an existing actor a unique name will be used by appending a suffix
   * to the the `name`. The exact format or value of the suffix is an implementation detail that is
   * undefined. This means that reusing the same name for several actors will not result in
   * `InvalidActorNameException`, but it's better to use unique names to begin with.

 * A behavior interceptor allows for intercepting message and signal reception and perform arbitrary logic -

 *
 * The `BehaviorInterceptor` API is considered a low level tool for building other features and
 * shouldn't be used for "normal" application logic. Several built-in intercepting behaviors
 * are provided through factories in the respective `Behaviors`.
 *
 * If the interceptor does keep mutable state care must be taken to create a new instance from
 * the factory function of `Behaviors.intercept` so that a new instance is created per spawned
 * actor rather than shared among actor instance.
 *
 * @param interceptMessageClass Ensures that the interceptor will only receive `O` message types.
 *                              If the message is not of this class or a subclass thereof

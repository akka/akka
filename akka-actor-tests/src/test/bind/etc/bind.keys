# The bind.keys file is used to override the built-in DNSSEC trust anchors
# which are included as part of BIND 9.  The only trust anchors it contains
# are for the DNS root zone (".").  Trust anchors for any other zones MUST
# be configured elsewhere; if they are configured here, they will not be
# recognized or used by named.
#
# The built-in trust anchors are provided for convenience of configuration.
# They are not activated within named.conf unless specifically switched on.
# To use the built-in key, use "dnssec-validation auto;" in the
# named.conf options.  Without this option being set, the keys in this
# file are ignored.
#
# This file is NOT expected to be user-configured.
#
# These keys are current as of October 2017.  If any key fails to
# initialize correctly, it may have expired.  In that event you should
# replace this file with a current version.  The latest version of
# bind.keys can always be obtained from ISC at https://www.isc.org/bind-keys.
#
# See https://data.iana.org/root-anchors/root-anchors.xml
# for current trust anchor information for the root zone.

.. _ConnectionLevelApi:

Connection-Level Client-Side API
================================

The connection-level API is the lowest-level client-side API Akka HTTP provides. It gives you full control over when
HTTP connections are opened and closed and how requests are to be send across which connection. As such it offers the
highest flexibility at the cost of providing the least convenience.


Opening HTTP Connections
------------------------

With the connection-level API you open a new HTTP connection by materializing a ``Flow`` returned by the
``Http.outgoingConnection(...)`` method. The target endpoint to which a connection is to be opened needs to be
specified as an argument to ``Http.outgoingConnection(...)``. Here is an example:

.. includecode:: ../../code/docs/http/scaladsl/HttpClientExampleSpec.scala
   :include: outgoing-connection-example

Apart from the host name and port the ``Http.outgoingConnection(...)`` method also allows you to specify socket options
and a number of configuration settings for the connection.

Note that no connection is attempted until the returned flow is actually materialized! If the flow is materialized
several times then several independent connections will be opened (one per materialization).
If the connection attempt fails, for whatever reason, the materialized flow will be immediately terminated with a
respective exception.


Request-Response Cycle
----------------------

Once the connection flow has been materialized it is ready to consume ``HttpRequest`` instances from the source it is
attached to. Each request is sent across the connection and incoming responses dispatched to the downstream pipeline.
Of course and as always, back-pressure is adequately maintained across all parts of the
connection. This means that, if the downstream pipeline consuming the HTTP responses is slow, the request source will
eventually be slowed down in sending requests.

Any errors occurring on the underlying connection are surfaced as exceptions terminating the response stream (and
canceling the request source).

Note that, if the source produces subsequent requests before the prior responses have arrived, these requests will be
pipelined__ across the connection, which is something that is not supported by all HTTP servers.
Also, if the server closes the connection before responses to all requests have been received this will result in the
response stream being terminated with a truncation error.

Closing Connections
-------------------

Akka HTTP actively closes an established connection upon reception of a response containing ``Connection: close`` header.
Of course the connection can also be closed by the server.

An application can actively trigger the closing of the connection by completing the request stream. In this case the
underlying TCP connection will be closed when the last pending response has been received.


Timeouts
--------

Currently Akka HTTP doesn't implement client-side request timeout checking itself as this functionality can be regarded
as a more general purpose streaming infrastructure feature.
However, akka-stream should soon provide such a feature.

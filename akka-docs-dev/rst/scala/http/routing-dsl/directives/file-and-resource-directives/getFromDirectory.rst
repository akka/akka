   :snippet: getFromDirectory

Description
-----------

The ``unmatchedPath`` of the ``RequestContext`` is first transformed by the given ``pathRewriter`` function before being
appended to the given directory name to build the final file name.

The actual I/O operation is running detached in a `Future`, so it doesn't block the current thread. If the file cannot
be read the route rejects the request.

To serve a single file use ``getFromFile``. To serve browsable directory listings use ``getFromBrowseableDirectories``.
To serve files from a classpath directory use ``getFromResourceDirectory`` instead.

Note that it's not required to wrap this directive with ``get`` as this directive will only respond to ``GET`` requests.

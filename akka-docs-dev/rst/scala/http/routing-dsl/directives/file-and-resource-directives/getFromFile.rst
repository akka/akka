   :snippet: getFromFile

Description
-----------

The actual I/O operation is running detached in a `Future`, so it doesn't block the current thread (but potentially
some other thread !). If the file cannot be found or read the request is rejected.

To serve files from a directory use ``getFromDirectory``, instead. To serve a file from a classpath resource
use ``getFromResource`` instead.

Note that it's not required to wrap this directive with ``get`` as this directive will only respond to ``GET`` requests.

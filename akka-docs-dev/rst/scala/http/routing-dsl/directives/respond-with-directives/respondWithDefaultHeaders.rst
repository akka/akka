   :snippet: respondWithDefaultHeaders


Description
-----------

This directive transforms ``HttpResponse`` and ``ChunkedResponseStart`` messages coming back from its inner route by
potentially adding the given ``HttpHeader`` instances to the headers list.
A header is only added if there is no header instance with the same name (case insensitively) already present in the
response. If you'd like to add only a single header you can use the :ref:`-respondWithDefaultHeader-` directive instead.


Example
-------

See the :ref:`-respondWithDefaultHeader-` directive for an example with only one header.

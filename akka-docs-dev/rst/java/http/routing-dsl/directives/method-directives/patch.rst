patch
=====

Matches requests with HTTP method ``PATCH``.

This directive filters the incoming request by its HTTP method. Only requests with
method ``PATCH`` are passed on to the inner route. All others are rejected with a
``MethodRejection``, which is translated into a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` response
by the default ``RejectionHandler``.

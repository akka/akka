== Akka Remote Sample Application ==

This sample has two different samples:
  - Server Managed Remote Actors Sample
  - Client Managed Remote Actors Sample

---------------------------------------------------------
= Server Managed Remote Actors Sample = 

To run the sample: 

1. Fire up two shells. For each of them:
  - Step down into to the root of the Akka distribution.
  - Set 'export AKKA_HOME=<root of distribution>.
  - Run 'sbt'
  - Run 'update' followed by 'compile' if you have not done that before.
  - Run 'project akka-sample-remote'
  - Run 'console' to start up a REPL (interpreter).
2. In the first REPL you get execute: 
  - scala> import sample.remote._
  - scala> ServerManagedRemoteActorServer.run
    This starts up the RemoteNode and registers the remote actor
3. In the second REPL you get execute: 
    - scala> import sample.remote._
    - scala> ServerManagedRemoteActorClient.run
4. See the actor conversation.
5. Run it again to see full speed after first initialization.

Now you could test client reconnect by killing the console running the ServerManagedRemoteActorClient and start it up again. See the client reconnect take place in the REPL shell.

That’s it. Have fun.

Ants
====

Ants is written by Peter Vlugter.

Ants is roughly based on the Clojure [ants simulation][ants.clj] by Rich Hickey, and ported to Scala using [Akka][akka] and [Spde][spde].

Requirements
------------

To build and run Ants you need [Simple Build Tool][sbt] (sbt).

Running
-------

First time, 'sbt update' to get dependencies, then to run Ants use 'sbt run'. 
Here is an example. First type 'sbt' to start SBT interactively, the run 'update' and 'run': 
> cd $AKKA_HOME

> % sbt

> > project akka-sample-ants

> > run


Notice
------

Ants is roughly based on the Clojure ants simulation by Rich Hickey.

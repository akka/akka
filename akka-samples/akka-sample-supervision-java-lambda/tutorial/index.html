    <h2>Quick Overview</h2>

    <p>Congratulations! You have just created your first fault-resilient Akka
        application, nice job!</p>

    <p>Let's start with an overview and discuss the problem we want
        to solve. This tutorial application demonstrates the use of Akka
        supervision hierarchies to implement reliable systems. This particular
        example demonstrates a calculator service that calculates arithmetic
        expressions. We will visit each of the components shortly, but you might
        want to take a quick look at the components before we move on.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="#code/src/main/java/supervision/Expression.java" class="shortcut">Expression.java</a>
            contains our "domain model", a very simple representation of
            arithmetic expressions
        </li>
        <li><a href="#code/src/main/java/supervision/ArithmeticService.java"
               class="shortcut">ArithmeticService.java</a> is the entry point
            for our calculation service
        </li>
        <li><a href="#code/src/main/java/supervision/FlakyExpressionCalculator.java"
               class="shortcut">FlakyExpressionCalculator.java</a> is our
            heavy-lifter, a worker actor that can evaluate an expression
            concurrently
        </li>
        <li><a href="#code/src/main/java/supervision/Main.java" class="shortcut">Main.java</a>
            example code that starts up the calculator service and sends a few
            jobs to it
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The Expression Model</h2>

    <p>Our service deals with arithmetic expressions on integers involving
        addition, multiplication and (integer) division. In
        <a href="#code/src/main/java/supervision/Expression.java" class="shortcut">Expression.java</a>
        you can see a very simple model of these kind of expressions.</p>

    <p>Any arithmetic expression is a descendant of <code>Expression</code>, and
        have a left and right side (<code>Const</code> is the only exception)
        which is also an <code>Expression</code>.</p>

    <p>For example, the expression (3 + 5) / (2 * (1 + 1)) could be constructed
        as:</p>


<code><pre>
new Divide(
  new Add(
    new Const(3),
    new Const(5)
  ),        // (3 + 5)
  new Multiply(
    new Const(2),
    new Add(
      new Const(1),
      new Const(1)
    )       // (1 + 1)
  )         // (2 * (1 + 1))
);          // (3 + 5) / (2 * (1 + 1))
</pre></code>

    <p>Apart from the encoding of an expression and some pretty printing, our
        model does not provide other services, so lets move on, and see how we
        can calculate the result of such expressions.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Arithmetic Service</h2>

    <p>Our entry point is the <a
            href="#code/src/main/java/supervision/ArithmeticService.java"
            class="shortcut">ArithmeticService</a> actor that accepts arithmetic
        expressions, calculates them and returns the result to the original
        sender of the <code>Expression</code>.This
        logic is implemented in the <code>receive</code> block. The actor
        handles <code>Expression</code> messages and starts a worker for them,
        carefully recording which worker belongs to which requester in the
        <code>pendingWorkers</code> map.
    </p>

    <p>Who calculates
        the expression? As you see, on the reception of an
        <code>Expression</code> message we create a <code>FlakyExpressionCalculator</code>
        actor and pass the expression as a parameter to its <code>Props</code>.
        What happens here is that we delegate the calculation work to a worker
        actor because the work can be "dangerous". After the worker
        finishes its job, it replies to its parent (in this
        case <code>ArithmeticService</code>) with a <code>Result</code>
        message. At this point the top level service actor looks up which
        actor it needs to send the final result to, and forwards it the value
        of the computation.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>The Dangers of Arithmetic</h2>

    <p>At first, it might feel strange that we don't calculate the result
        directly but we delegate it to a new actor. The reason for that, is that
        we want to treat the calculation as a dangerous task and isolate its
        execution in a different actor to keep the top level service safe.</p>

    <p>In our example we will see two kinds of failures</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>FlakinessException</code> is a dummy exception that we throw
            randomly to simulate transient failures. We will assume that
            flakiness is temporary, and retrying the calculation is enough to
            eventually get rid of the failure.
        </li>
        <li>Fatal failures, like <code>ArithmeticException</code> that will not
            go away no matter how many times we retry the task. Division by zero
            is a good example, since it indicates that the expression is
            invalid, and no amount of attempts to calculate it again will fix
            it.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To handle these kind of failure modes differently we customized the
        supervisor strategy of <a
                href="#code/src/main/java/supervision/ArithmeticService.java"
                class="shortcut">ArithmeticService</a>. Our strategy here
        is to restart the child when a recoverable error is detected (in our
        case the dummy <code>FlakinessException</code>), but when arithmetic
        errors happen &mdash; like division by zero &mdash; we have no hope to recover
        and therefore we stop the worker. In addition,
        we have to notify the original requester of the calculation job
        about the failure.</p>

    <p>We used <code>OneForOneStrategy</code>, since we only want to act on the
        failing child, not on all of our children at the same time.</p>

    <p>We set <code>loggingEnabled</code> to false, since we wanted to use our
        custom logging instead of the built-in reporting.</p>



</div>

<div>

    <h2>The Joy of Calculation</h2>

    <p>We have now seen our <code>Expression</code> model, our fault modes
        and how we deal with them at the top level, delegating the dangerous
        work to child workers to isolate the failure, and setting
        <code>Stop</code> or <code>Restart</code> directives depending on the
        nature of the failure (fatal or transient). Now it's time to
        calculate and visit <a href="#code/src/main/java/supervision/FlakyExpressionCalculator.java"
                               class="shortcut">FlakyExpressionCalculator.java</a>!
    </p>

    <p>Let's review first our evaluation strategy. When we are facing an
        expression like ((4 * 4) / (3 + 1)) we might be tempted to calculate (4
        * 4) first, then (3 + 1), and then the final division. We can do better:
        Let's calculate the two sides of the division in parallel!</p>

    <p>To achieve this, our worker delegates the calculation of the left and
        right side of the expression it has been given to two child workers of
        the same type (except in the case of constant, where it just sends its
        value as <code>Result</code> to its parent.
        This logic is in <code>preStart()</code>
        since this is the code that will be executed when an actor starts (and
        during restarts if the <code>postRestart()</code> is not
        overridden).</p>

    <p>Since any of the sides of the original expression can finish before the
        other, we have to indicate somehow which side has been calculated, that
        is why we pass a <code>Position</code> as an argument to workers which
        they will put in their <code>Result</code> which they send after the
        calculation finished successfully.</p>

</div>
<div>


    <h2>Failing Calculations</h2>

    <p>As you might have observed, we added a method called
        <code>flakiness()</code> that sometimes just misbehaves
        (throws a <code>FlakinessException</code>).
        This simulates a transient failure. Let's see how our
        FlakyExpressionCalculator deals with failure situations.</p>

    <p>A supervisor strategy is applied to the children of an actor. Since our
        children are actually workers for calculating the left and right side of
        our subexpression, we have to think what different failures mean for
        us.</p>

    <p>If we encounter a <code>FlakinessException</code> it indicates that one
        of our workers
        just made a hiccup and failed to calculate the answer. Since we know
        this failure is recoverable, we just restart the responsible worker.</p>

    <p>In case of fatal failures we cannot really do anything ourselves. First
        of all, it indicates that the expression is invalid so restart does not
        help, second, we are not necessarily the top level worker for the
        expression. When an unknown failure is encountered it
        is escalated to the parent. The parent of this actor is either another
        <code>FlakyExpressionCalculator</code> or the
        <code>ArithmeticService </code>. Since the calculators all escalate, no
        matter how deep the failure happened, the <code>ArithmeticService</code>
        will decide on the fate of the job (in our case, stop it).</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>When to Split Work? A Small Detour.</h2>

    <p>In our example we split expressions recursively and calculated the left
       and right sides of each of the expressions. The question naturally
       arises: do we gain anything here regarding performance?</p>

    <p>In this example more probably not. There is an additional overhead of
       splitting up tasks and collecting results, and this case the actual
       subtasks consist of simple arithmetic operations which are very fast.
       To really gain in performance in practice, the actual subtasks have to
       be more heavyweight than this &mdash; but the pattern will be the
       same.</p>

</div>
<div>
    <h2>Where to go from here?</h2>

    <p>After getting comfortable with the code, you can test your
        understanding by trying to solve the following small exercises:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add <code>flakiness()</code> to various places in the calculator and
            see what happens
        </li>
        <li>Try devising more calculation intensive nested jobs instead of
            arithmetic expressions (for example transformations of a text
            document) where parallelism improves performance
        </li>
    </ul>

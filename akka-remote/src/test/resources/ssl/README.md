# Testing Resources

This folder contains a diverse set of keys, certificates and keystores generated using scripts inspired by 
those from https://github.com/playframework/play-samples/tree/2.8.x/play-scala-tls-example/scripts. 

The resources in this folder are build with a few restrictions. See `TlsResourcesSpec.scala` for some 
tests asserting the certificates and keys in this folder fulfill the required restrictions.

/*
 * This test is a simulation of the actual concurrent rolling log implemented in SnapshottableRollingEventLog. It
 * is not possible to test the implementation to such extent than this simulation allows, however, the two implementations
 * must be kept in sync manually (it is expected to remain simple though).
 *
 * It is very important to not get corrupted results from the Flight Recorder as they can lead to completely misinterpreted
 * results when debugging using the logs. This simulation tries to uncover many race scenarios by simulating the
 * algorithm down to the individual byte write level.

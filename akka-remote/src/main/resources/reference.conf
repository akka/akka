    ### Security settings

    # can take the values OFF, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, or ON. For compatibility
    # reasons the setting "on" will default to "debug" level. Please note that the effective
    # logging level is still determined by the global logging level of the actor system:

    # is running with debug level logging.

/**
 * Implementation of 'The Phi Accrual Failure Detector' by Hayashibara et al. as defined in their paper:
 * [https://oneofus.la/have-emacs-will-hack/files/HDY04.pdf]
 *
 * The suspicion level of failure is given by a value called φ (phi).
 * The basic idea of the φ failure detector is to express the value of φ on a scale that
 * is dynamically adjusted to reflect current network conditions. A configurable
 * threshold is used to decide if φ is considered to be a failure.
 *
 * The value of φ is calculated as:
 *
 * {{{
 * φ = -log10(1 - F(timeSinceLastHeartbeat)
 * }}}
 * where F is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution with mean
 * and standard deviation estimated from historical heartbeat inter-arrival times.
 *
 * @param threshold A low threshold is prone to generate many wrong suspicions but ensures a quick detection in the event
 *   of a real crash. Conversely, a high threshold generates fewer mistakes but needs more time to detect
 *   actual crashes
 * @param maxSampleSize Number of samples to use for calculation of mean and standard deviation of
 *   inter-arrival times.
 * @param minStdDeviation Minimum standard deviation to use for the normal distribution used when calculating phi.
 *   Too low standard deviation might result in too much sensitivity for sudden, but normal, deviations
 *   in heartbeat inter arrival times.
 * @param acceptableHeartbeatPause Duration corresponding to number of potentially lost/delayed
 *   heartbeats that will be accepted before considering it to be an anomaly.
 *   This margin is important to be able to survive sudden, occasional, pauses in heartbeat
 *   arrivals, due to for example garbage collect or network drop.
 * @param firstHeartbeatEstimate Bootstrap the stats with heartbeats that corresponds to
 *   to this duration, with a with rather high standard deviation (since environment is unknown
 *   in the beginning)
 * @param clock The clock, returning current time in milliseconds, but can be faked for testing
 *   purposes. It is only used for measuring intervals (duration).

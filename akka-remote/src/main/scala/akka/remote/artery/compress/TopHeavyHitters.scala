 * Mutable, open-addressing with linear-probing (though naive one which in theory could get pathological) heavily optimised "top N heavy hitters" data-structure.
 *
 * Keeps a number of specific heavy hitters around in memory.
 *
 * See also Section 5.2 of http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/~graham/pubs/papers/cm-full.pdf
 * for a discussion about the assumptions made and guarantees about the Heavy Hitters made in this model.
 * We assume the Cash Register model in which there are only additions, which simplifies HH detection significantly.
 *
 * This class is a hybrid data structure containing a hashmap and a heap pointing to slots in the hashmap. The capacity
 * of the hashmap is twice that of the heap to reduce clumping of entries on collisions.

   * - Each heap slot contains the index of the hashmap slot where the actual element is, or contains -1
   * - Empty heap slots contain a negative index
   * - Each hashmap slot should contain the index of the heap slot where the element currently is
   * - Initially the heap is filled with "pseudo" elements (-1 entries with weight 0). This ensures that when the
   *   heap is not full a "lowestHitterWeight" of zero is reported. This also ensures that we can always safely
   *   remove the "lowest hitter" without checking the capacity, as when the heap is not full it will contain a
   *   "pseudo" element as lowest hitter which can be safely removed without affecting real entries.
   */

  /*
   * Insertion of a new element works like this:
   *  1. Check if its weight is larger than the lowest hitter we know. If the heap is not full, then due to the
   *    presence of "pseudo" elements (-1 entries in heap with weight 0) this will always succeed.
   *  2. Do a quick scan for a matching hashcode with findHashIdx. This only searches for the first candidate (one
   *    with equal hash).
   *    a. If this returns -1, we know this is a new entry (there is no other entry with matching hashcode).
   *    b. Else, this returns a nonnegative number. Now we do a more thorough scan from here, actually checking for
   *       object equality by calling findItemIdx (discarding false positives due to hash collisions). Since this
   *       is a new entry, the result will be -1 (the candidate was a colliding false positive).
   *  3. Call insertKnownHeavy
   *  4. This removes the lowest hitter first from the hashmap.
   *    a. If the heap is not full, this will be just a "pseudo" element (-1 entry with weight 0) so no "real" entries
   *       are evicted.
   *    b. If the heap is full, then a real entry is evicted. This is correct as the new entry has higher weight than
   *       the evicted one due to the check in step 1.
   *  5. The new entry is inserted into the hashmap and its entry index is recorded
   *  6. Overwrite the top of the heap with inserted element's index (again, correct, this was the evicted real or
   *     "pseudo" element).
   *  7. Restore heap property by pushing down the new element from the top if necessary.
   */

  /*
   * Update of an existing element works like this:
   * 1. Check if its weight is larger than the lowest hitter we know. This will succeed as weights can only be
   *    incremented.
   * 2. Do a quick scan for a matching hashcode with findHashIdx. This only searches for the first candidate (one
   *    with equal hash). This does not check for actual entry equality yet, but it can quickly skip surely non-matching
   *    entries. Since this is an existing element, we will find an index that is a candidate for actual equality.
   * 3. Now do a more thorough scan from this candidate index checking for hash *and* object equality (to skip
   *    potentially colliding entries). We will now have the real index of the existing entry if the previous scan
   *    found a false positive.
   * 4. Call updateExistingHeavyHitter
   * 5. Update the recorded weight for this entry in the hashmap (at the index we previously found)
   * 6. Fix the Heap property (since now weight can be larger than one of its heap children nodes). Please note that
   *    we just swap heap entries around here, so no entry will be evicted.

Please consider the following before opening a ticket:

- Do you have a general QUESTION? 
  - Please use the mailing list instead: https://groups.google.com/group/akka-user/

- Do you want to real-time discuss USING AKKA?
  - Please use the gitter chat: http://gitter.im/akka/dev
    As it's a real-time chat, you may not get a response, in which case perhaps ask your question on akka-user
  
- Do you want to discuss DEVELOPING AKKA?
  - Please use the "developer" gitter chat: http://gitter.im/akka/dev
    This chat is aimed specifically at developing Akka, or discussing what to implement etc.

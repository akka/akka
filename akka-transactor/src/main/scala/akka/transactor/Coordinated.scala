/**
 * `Coordinated` is a message wrapper that adds a `CommitBarrier` for explicitly
 * coordinating transactions across actors or threads.
 *
 * Creating a `Coordinated` will create a commit barrier with initially one member.
 * For each member in the coordination set a transaction is expected to be created using
 * the coordinated atomic method, or the coordination cancelled using the cancel method.
 *
 * The number of included members must match the number of transactions, otherwise a
 * successful transaction cannot be coordinated.
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * To start a new coordinated transaction set that you will also participate in just create
 * a `Coordinated` object:
 *
 * {{{
 * val coordinated = Coordinated()
 * }}}
 * <br/>
 *
 * To start a coordinated transaction that you won't participate in yourself you can create a
 * `Coordinated` object with a message and send it directly to an actor. The recipient of the message
 * will be the first member of the coordination set:
 *
 * {{{
 * actor ! Coordinated(Message)
 * }}}
 * <br/>
 *
 * To receive a coordinated message in an actor simply match it in a case statement:
 *
 * {{{
 * def receive = {
 *   case coordinated @ Coordinated(Message) => ...
 * }
 * }}}
 * <br/>
 *
 * To include another actor in the same coordinated transaction set that you've created or
 * received, use the apply method on that object. This will increment the number of parties
 * involved by one and create a new `Coordinated` object to be sent.
 *
 * {{{
 * actor ! coordinated(Message)
 * }}}
 * <br/>
 *
 * To enter the coordinated transaction use the atomic method of the coordinated object:
 *
 * {{{
 * coordinated.atomic { implicit txn =>
 *   // do something in transaction ...
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * The coordinated transaction will wait for the other transactions before committing.
 * If any of the coordinated transactions fail then they all fail.
 *
 * @see [[akka.actor.Transactor]] for an actor that implements coordinated transactions

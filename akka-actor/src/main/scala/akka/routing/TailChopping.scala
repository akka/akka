/**
 * As each message is sent to the router, the routees are randomly ordered. The message is sent to the
 * first routee. If no response is received before the `interval` has passed, the same message is sent
 * to the next routee. This process repeats until either a response is received from some routee, the
 * routees in the pool are exhausted, or the `within` duration has passed since the first send. If no
 * routee sends a response in time, a [[akka.actor.Status.Failure]] wrapping a [[akka.pattern.AskTimeoutException]]
 * is sent to the sender.
 *
 * The goal of this routing algorithm is to decrease tail latencies ("chop off the tail latency") in situations
 * where multiple routees can perform the same piece of work, and where a routee may occasionally respond
 * more slowly than expected. In this case, sending the same work request (also known as a "backup request")
 * to another actor results in decreased response time - because it's less probable that multiple actors
 * are under heavy load simultaneously. This technique is explained in depth in Jeff Dean's presentation on
 * <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//people/jeff/Berkeley-Latency-Mar2012.pdf">

 *
 * <h1>Supervision Setup</h1>
 *
 * Any routees that are created by a router will be created as the router's children.
 * The router is therefore also the children's supervisor.
 *
 * The supervision strategy of the router actor can be configured with
 * [[#withSupervisorStrategy]]. If no strategy is provided, routers default to
 * a strategy of “always escalate”. This means that errors are passed up to the
 * router's supervisor for handling.
 *
 * The router's supervisor will treat the error as an error with the router itself.
 * Therefore a directive to stop or restart will cause the router itself to stop or
 * restart. The router, in turn, will cause its children to stop and restart.
 *
 * @param nrOfInstances initial number of routees in the pool

 * @param resizer optional resizer that dynamically adjust the pool size

 *
 * <h1>Supervision Setup</h1>
 *
 * Any routees that are created by a router will be created as the router's children.
 * The router is therefore also the children's supervisor.
 *
 * The supervision strategy of the router actor can be configured with
 * [[#withSupervisorStrategy]]. If no strategy is provided, routers default to
 * a strategy of “always escalate”. This means that errors are passed up to the
 * router's supervisor for handling.
 *
 * The router's supervisor will treat the error as an error with the router itself.
 * Therefore a directive to stop or restart will cause the router itself to stop or
 * restart. The router, in turn, will cause its children to stop and restart.
 *
 * @param nrOfInstances initial number of routees in the pool
 *
 * @param resizer optional resizer that dynamically adjust the pool size
 *
 * @param supervisorStrategy strategy for supervising the routees, see 'Supervision Setup'
 *
 * @param routerDispatcher dispatcher to use for the router head actor, which handles
 *   supervision, death watch and router management messages

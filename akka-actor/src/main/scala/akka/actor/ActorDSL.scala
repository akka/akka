/**
 * The ActorDSL trait provides factory methods which allow creating actors
 * using a very lightweight syntax which simplifies programming with actors
 * in the interactive interpreter, for example.
 *
 * Moreover, the ActorDSL trait provides an actor interface for the current
 * thread. By importing the `self` member, the current thread is treated
 * as an implicit sender when sending messages outside of a regular actor.
 * Using the `receive` method, the current thread can receive messages
 * sent to its actor reference.
 *
 * @tparam A  The type of the actor trait
 * @tparam AR The type of the actor reference returned by factory methods
 * @tparam CT The type of the internal actor context

/**
 * Java API: compatible with lambda expressions
 *
 * Actor base class that should be extended to create an actor with a stash.
 *
 * The stash enables an actor to temporarily stash away messages that can not or
 * should not be handled using the actor's current behavior.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyActorWithStash extends AbstractActorWithStash {
 *   int count = 0;
 *
 *   public MyActorWithStash() {
 *     receive(ReceiveBuilder. match(String.class, s -> {

 *         stash();
 *       }}).build()
 *     );
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Note that the subclasses of `AbstractActorWithStash` by default request a Deque based mailbox since this class
 * implements the `RequiresMessageQueue&lt;DequeBasedMessageQueueSemantics&gt;` marker interface.
 * You can override the default mailbox provided when `DequeBasedMessageQueueSemantics` are requested via config:
 * <pre>
 *   akka.actor.mailbox.requirements {
 *     "akka.dispatch.BoundedDequeBasedMessageQueueSemantics" = your-custom-mailbox
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Alternatively, you can add your own requirement marker to the actor and configure a mailbox type to be used
 * for your marker.
 *
 * For a `Stash` based actor that enforces unbounded deques see [[akka.actor.AbstractActorWithUnboundedStash]].
 * There is also an unrestricted version [[akka.actor.AbstractActorWithUnrestrictedStash]] that does not
 * enforce the mailbox type.
 *
 * This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature and is subject to change until it has received more real world testing.

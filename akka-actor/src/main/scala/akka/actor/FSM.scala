 *
 *     case class Data(i : Int)
 *   }

 *     startWith(One, Data(42))
 *     when(One) {
 *         case Event(SomeMsg, Data(x)) => ...
 *         case Event(SomeOtherMsg, _) => ... // when data not needed
 *     }
 *     when(Two, stateTimeout = 5 seconds) { ... }
 *     initialize()
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Within the partial function the following values are returned for effecting
 * state transitions:
 *
 *  - <code>stay</code> for staying in the same state
 *  - <code>stay using Data(...)</code> for staying in the same state, but with
 *    different data
 *  - <code>stay forMax 5.millis</code> for staying with a state timeout; can be
 *    combined with <code>using</code>
 *  - <code>goto(...)</code> for changing into a different state; also supports
 *    <code>using</code> and <code>forMax</code>
 *  - <code>stop</code> for terminating this FSM actor
 *
 * Each of the above also supports the method <code>replying(AnyRef)</code> for
 * sending a reply before changing state.
 *
 * While changing state, custom handlers may be invoked which are registered
 * using <code>onTransition</code>. This is meant to enable concentrating
 * different concerns in different places; you may choose to use
 * <code>when</code> for describing the properties of a state, including of
 * course initiating transitions, but you can describe the transitions using
 * <code>onTransition</code> to avoid having to duplicate that code among
 * multiple paths which lead to a transition:
 *
 * <pre>
 * onTransition {
 *   case Active -&gt; _ =&gt; cancelTimer("activeTimer")
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Multiple such blocks are supported and all of them will be called, not only
 * the first matching one.
 *
 * Another feature is that other actors may subscribe for transition events by
 * sending a <code>SubscribeTransitionCallback</code> message to this actor.
 * Stopping a listener without unregistering will not remove the listener from the
 * subscription list; use <code>UnsubscribeTransitionCallback</code> before stopping
 * the listener.
 *
 * State timeouts set an upper bound to the time which may pass before another
 * message is received in the current state. If no external message is
 * available, then upon expiry of the timeout a StateTimeout message is sent.
 * Note that this message will only be received in the state for which the
 * timeout was set and that any message received will cancel the timeout
 * (possibly to be started again by the next transition).
 *
 * Another feature is the ability to install and cancel single-shot as well as
 * repeated timers which arrange for the sending of a user-specified message:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   setTimer("tock", TockMsg, 1 second, true) // repeating
 *   setTimer("lifetime", TerminateMsg, 1 hour, false) // single-shot
 *   cancelTimer("tock")
 *   isTimerActive("tock")
 * </pre>

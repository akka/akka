 *
 * An actor has a well-defined (non-cyclic) life-cycle.
 *  - ''RUNNING'' (created and started actor) - can receive messages
 *  - ''SHUTDOWN'' (when 'stop' or 'exit' is invoked) - can't do anything
 *
 * The Actor's own [[akka.actor.ActorRef]] is available as `self`, the current
 * message’s sender as `sender` and the [[akka.actor.ActorContext]] as
 * `context`. The only abstract method is `receive` which shall return the
 * initial behavior of the actor as a partial function (behavior can be changed
 * using `context.become` and `context.unbecome`).

 * If you don’t like writing `context` you can always `import context._` to get

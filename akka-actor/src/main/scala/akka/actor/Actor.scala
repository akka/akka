 * Actor base trait that should be extended by or mixed to create an Actor with the semantics of the 'Actor Model':
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model</a>
 *
 * An actor has a well-defined (non-cyclic) life-cycle.
 *  - ''RUNNING'' (created and started actor) - can receive messages
 *  - ''SHUTDOWN'' (when 'stop' or 'exit' is invoked) - can't do anything
 *
 * The Actor's own [[akka.actor.ActorRef]] is available as `self`, the current
 * message’s sender as `sender` and the [[akka.actor.ActorContext]] as
 * `context`. The only abstract method is `receive` which shall return the
 * initial behavior of the actor as a partial function (behavior can be changed
 * using `context.become` and `context.unbecome`).

 *
 * The last line demonstrates the essence of the error kernel design: spawn
 * one-off actors which terminate after doing their job, pass on `sender` to
 * allow direct reply if that is what makes sense, or round-trip the sender
 * as shown with the fictitious JobRequest/JobReply message pair.
 *
 * If you don’t like writing `context` you can always `import context._` to get
 * direct access to `actorOf`, `stop` etc. This is not default in order to keep
 * the name-space clean.

 *
 * An actor has a well-defined (non-cyclic) life-cycle.

 *  - ''SHUTDOWN'' (when 'stop' is invoked) - can't do anything
 *
 * The Actor's own [[akka.actor.ActorRef]] is available as `self`, the current
 * message’s sender as `sender()` and the [[akka.actor.ActorContext]] as
 * `context`. The only abstract method is `receive` which shall return the
 * initial behavior of the actor as a partial function (behavior can be changed
 * using `context.become` and `context.unbecome`).
 *
 * This is the Scala API (hence the Scala code below), for the Java API see [[akka.actor.UntypedActor]].

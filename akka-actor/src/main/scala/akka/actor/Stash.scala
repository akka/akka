/**
 *  The `Stash` trait enables an actor to temporarily stash away messages that can not or
 *  should not be handled using the actor's current behavior.
 *  <p/>
 *  Example:
 *  <pre>
 *    class ActorWithProtocol extends Actor with Stash {
 *      def receive = {
 *        case "open" ⇒
 *          unstashAll()
 *          context.become({
 *            case "write" ⇒ // do writing...
 *            case "close" ⇒
 *              unstashAll()
 *              context.unbecome()
 *            case msg ⇒ stash()
 *          }, discardOld = false)
 *        case "done" ⇒ // done
 *        case msg    ⇒ stash()
 *      }
 *    }
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  Note that the `Stash` trait can only be used together with actors that have a deque-based
 *  mailbox. By default Stash based actors request a Deque based mailbox since the stash
 *  trait extends `RequiresMessageQueue[DequeBasedMessageQueueSemantics]`.
 *  You can override the default mailbox provided when `DequeBasedMessageQueueSemantics` are requested via config:
 *  <pre>
 *    akka.actor.mailbox.requirements {
 *      "akka.dispatch.BoundedDequeBasedMessageQueueSemantics" = your-custom-mailbox
 *    }
 *  </pre>
 *  Alternatively, you can add your own requirement marker to the actor and configure a mailbox type to be used
 *  for your marker.
 *
 *  For a `Stash` that also enforces unboundedness of the deque see [[akka.actor.UnboundedStash]]. For a `Stash`
 *  that does not enforce any mailbox type see [[akka.actor.UnrestrictedStash]].
 *
 *  Note that the `Stash` trait must be mixed into (a subclass of) the `Actor` trait before
 *  any trait/class that overrides the `preRestart` callback. This means it's not possible to write
 *  `Actor with MyActor with Stash` if `MyActor` overrides `preRestart`.

/**
 * An Akka scheduler service.

 * For scheduling within actors `with Timers` should be preferred.
 *
 * Please note that this scheduler implementation is highly optimised for high-throughput
 * and high-frequency events. It is not to be confused with long-term schedulers such as
 * Quartz. The scheduler will throw an exception if attempts are made to schedule too far
 * into the future (which by default is around 8 months (`Int.MaxValue` seconds).
 *
 * It's possible to implement a custom `Scheduler`, although that should rarely be needed.
 *
 * A `Scheduler` implementation needs one special behavior: if
 * Closeable, it MUST execute all outstanding tasks that implement [[Scheduler.TaskRunOnClose]]
 * upon .close() in order to properly shutdown all dispatchers.
 *
 * Furthermore, this timer service MUST throw IllegalStateException if it
 * cannot schedule a task. Once scheduled, the task MUST be executed. If
 * executed upon close(), the task may execute before its timeout.
 *
 * Scheduler implementation are loaded reflectively at ActorSystem start-up
 * with the following constructor arguments:
 *  1) the systemâ€™s com.typesafe.config.Config (from system.settings.config)
 *  2) a akka.event.LoggingAdapter
 *  3) a java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory

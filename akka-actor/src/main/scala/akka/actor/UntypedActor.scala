/**
 * Actor base trait that should be extended by or mixed to create an Actor with the semantics of the 'Actor Model':
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model</a>
 *
 * This class is the Java cousin to the [[akka.actor.Actor]] Scala interface.
 * Subclass this abstract class to create a MDB-style untyped actor.
 *
 * An actor has a well-defined (non-cyclic) life-cycle.
 *  - ''RUNNING'' (created and started actor) - can receive messages
 *  - ''SHUTDOWN'' (when 'stop' or 'exit' is invoked) - can't do anything
 *
 * The Actor's own [[akka.actor.ActorRef]] is available as `getSelf()`, the current
 * message’s sender as `getSender()` and the [[akka.actor.UntypedActorContext]] as
 * `getContext()`. The only abstract method is `onReceive()` which is invoked for
 * each processed message unless dynamically overridden using `getContext().become()`.
 *
 * Here is an example on how to create and use an UntypedActor:
 *
 * {{{
 *  public class SampleUntypedActor extends UntypedActor {
 *
 *    public class Reply {
 *      final public ActorRef sender;
 *      final public Result result;
 *      Reply(ActorRef sender, Result result) {
 *        this.sender = sender;
 *        this.result = result;
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 *   private static SupervisorStrategy strategy = new OneForOneStrategy(10, Duration.parse("1 minute"),
 *     new Function<Throwable, Directive>() {
 *       @Override
 *       public Directive apply(Throwable t) {
 *         if (t instanceof ArithmeticException) {
 *           return resume();
 *         } else if (t instanceof NullPointerException) {
 *           return restart();
 *         } else if (t instanceof IllegalArgumentException) {
 *           return stop();
 *         } else {
 *           return escalate();
 *         }
 *       }
 *     });
 *
 *   @Override
 *   public SupervisorStrategy supervisorStrategy() {
 *     return strategy;
 *    }
 *
 *    public void onReceive(Object message) throws Exception {
 *      if (message instanceof String) {
 *        String msg = (String)message;
 *
 *        if (msg.equals("UseSender")) {
 *          // Reply to original sender of message
 *          getSender().tell(msg + ":" + getSelf());
 *
 *        } else if (msg.equals("SendToSelf")) {
 *          // Send message to the actor itself recursively
 *          getSelf().tell("SomeOtherMessage");
 *
 *        } else if (msg.equals("ErrorKernelWithDirectReply")) {
 *          // Send work to one-off child which will reply directly to original sender
 *          getContext().actorOf(new Props(Worker.class)).tell("DoSomeDangerousWork", getSender());
 *
 *        } else if (msg.equals("ErrorKernelWithReplyHere")) {
 *          // Send work to one-off child and collect the answer, reply handled further down
 *          getContext().actorOf(new Props(Worker.class)).tell("DoWorkAndReplyToMe");
 *
 *        } else throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown message: " + message);
 *
 *      } else if (message instanceof Reply) {
 *
 *        final Reply reply = (Reply) message;
 *        // might want to do some processing/book-keeping here
 *        reply.sender.tell(reply.result);
 *
 *      } else throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown message: " + message);
 *    }
 *  }
 * }}}

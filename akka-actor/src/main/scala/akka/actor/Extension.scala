/**
 * The basic ActorSystem covers all that is needed for locally running actors,
 * using futures and so on. In addition, more features can hook into it and
 * thus become visible to actors et al by registering themselves as extensions.
 * This is accomplished by providing an extension—which is an object
 * implementing this trait—to `ActorSystem.registerExtension(...)` or by
 * specifying the corresponding option in the configuration passed to
 * ActorSystem, which will then instantiate (without arguments) each FQCN and
 * register the result.
 *
 * The extension itself can be created in any way desired and has full access
 * to the ActorSystem implementation.
 *
 * Scala example:
 *
 * {{{
 * class MyExtension extends Extension[MyExtension] {
 *   def init(system: ActorSystemImpl): ExtensionKey[MyExtension] = {
 *     ... // initialize here
 *     MyExtension
 *   }
 * }
 * object MyExtension extends ExtensionKey[MyExtension]
 * }}}
 *
 * Java example:
 *
 * {{{
 * static class MyExtension implements Extension<MyExtension> {
 *   public static ExtensionKey<MyExtension> key = new ExtensionKey<MyExtension>() {};
 *
 *   public ExtensionKey<MyExtension> init(ActorSystemImpl system) {
 *     ... // initialize here
 *     return key;
 *   }
 * }
 * }}}

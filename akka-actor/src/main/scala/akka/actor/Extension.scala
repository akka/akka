/**
 * The basic ActorSystem covers all that is needed for locally running actors,
 * using futures and so on. In addition, more features can hook into it and
 * thus become visible to actors et al by registering themselves as extensions.
 * This is accomplished by providing an extension—which is an object
 * implementing this trait—to `ActorSystem.registerExtension(...)` or by
 * specifying the corresponding option in the configuration passed to
 * ActorSystem, which will then instantiate (without arguments) each FQCN and
 * register the result.
 *
 * The extension itself can be created in any way desired and has full access
 * to the ActorSystem implementation.
 *
 * This trait is only a marker interface to signify an Akka Extension, see
 * [[akka.actor.ExtensionKey]] for a concise way of formulating extensions.

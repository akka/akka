/**
 * Base62 encoder/decoder.
 *
 * Unlike an encoding like Base64, a perfect Base62 encoding never aligns with the bytes - there are no whole numbers
 * for which you can say "for every n bytes, there are m characters output." This is because 62 and 256 share no common
 * exponents. So you can't perfectly break the input up into blocks, and encode it one block at a time, like you can
 * with Base64.
 *
 * Instead, we approximate it. We break the raw bytes into blocks of 8 bytes, and encoded blocks of 11 base62 digits.
 * This size was chosen because 62^^11 is greater than, but somewhat close to logarithmically, 256^^8. Because it's
 * greater than, it guarantees that every 8 byte block value can fit in 11 base62 characters, while the closeness
 * minimises the overhead due to values of 11 base62 characters that are too big to map to 8 bytes. I checked block
 * sizes up to 10, and found this yielded the best efficiency. Also, 8 is the longest input block size that allows us
 * to do all the arithmetic using primitive data types (in this case, unsigned long), rather than having to use a big
 * integer type, which would impact performance and make our code more complex.
 *
 * So, our encoded string is 11/8 (1.375) times longer than the input bytes, which is slightly worse than the optimal
 * base62 encoding efficiency of 8/log2(62), ie 1.344 times longer than the input bytes. But, implementing the optimal
 * encoding requires dividing the entire input byte array by 62 over and over, which would mean our encoding would run
 * in O(n2) rather than O(n).
 *
 * This does mean certain input strings, containing only valid base62 characters, may not be possible to decode. This
 * is also true with base64, but such corruptions can only happen in the last block, if the last block is one character
 * long. Whereas such corruptions can happen in any block in this encoding, for example, a block of only z's is invalid
 * anywhere in the encoded form.
 *
 * The encoder is reasonably performant. I haven't done any fine tunings or micro-benchmarks of it, but I have taken
 * care to ensure it does run in O(n), and avoided unnecessary buffer copies where possible. For the purposes of license
 * encoding, its runtime is negligible compared to the cryptographic signing and verification operations.
 *
 * There are other Base62 encoders out there, and they use a number of different incompatible approaches. Keybase has
 * a library called saltpack which contains a Base62 encoder. It uses the same block encoding approach, but with 32
 * byte blocks. However, its encoder is flexible enough to allow creating an encoder with any arbitrary block length.
 * This implementation has been verified to be compatible with the Keybase saltpack BaseX encoder for Base62 with a
 * block size of 8.

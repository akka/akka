/**
 * This pipeline stage implements SSL / TLS support, using an externally
 * configured [[javax.net.ssl.SSLEngine]]. It operates on the level of [[Tcp.Event]] and
 * [[Tcp.Command]] messages, which means that it will typically be one of
 * the lowest stages in a protocol stack. Since SSLEngine relies on contiguous
 * transmission of a data stream you will need to handle backpressure from
 * the TCP connection actor, for example by using a [[BackpressureBuffer]]
 * underneath the SSL stage.
 *
 * Each instance of this stage has a scratch [[ByteBuffer]] of approx. 18kiB
 * allocated which is used by the SSLEngine.
 *
 * One thing to keep in mind is that there's no support for half-closed connections
 * in SSL (but SSL on the other side requires half-closed connections from its transport
 * layer).
 *
 * This means:
 * 1. keepOpenOnPeerClosed is not supported on top of SSL (once you receive PeerClosed
 *    the connection is closed, further CloseCommands are ignored)
 * 2. keepOpenOnPeerClosed should always be enabled on the transport layer beneath SSL so
 *    that one can wait for the other side's SSL level close_notify message without barfing
 *    RST to the peer because this socket is already gone
 *

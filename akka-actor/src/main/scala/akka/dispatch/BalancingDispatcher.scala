/**
 * An executor based event driven dispatcher which will try to redistribute work from busy actors to idle actors. It is assumed
 * that all actors using the same instance of this dispatcher can process all messages that have been sent to one of the actors. I.e. the
 * actors belong to a pool of actors, and to the client there is no guarantee about which actor instance actually processes a given message.
 * <p/>
 * Although the technique used in this implementation is commonly known as "work stealing", the actual implementation is probably
 * best described as "work donating" because the actor of which work is being stolen takes the initiative.
 * <p/>
 * The preferred way of creating dispatchers is to define configuration of it and use the
 * the `lookup` method in [[akka.dispatch.Dispatchers]].

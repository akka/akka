/**
 * INTERNAL API
 *
 * Watches all actors which subscribe on the given eventStream, and unsubscribes them from it when they are Terminated.
 *
 * Assumptions note:
 * We do not guarantee happens-before in the EventStream when 2 threads subscribe(a) / unsubscribe(a) on the same actor,
 * thus the messages sent to this actor may appear to be reordered - this is fine, because the worst-case is starting to
 * needlessly watch the actor which will not cause trouble for the stream. This is a trade-off between slowing down
 * subscribe calls * because of the need of linearizing the history message sequence and the possibility of sometimes
 * watching a few actors too much - we opt for the 2nd choice here.

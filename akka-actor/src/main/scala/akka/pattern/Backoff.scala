   * Back-off options for creating a back-off supervisor actor that expects a child actor to restart on failure.
   *
   * This explicit supervisor behaves similarly to the normal implicit supervision where
   * if an actor throws an exception, the decider on the supervisor will decide when to
   * `Stop`, `Restart`, `Escalate`, `Resume` the child actor.
   *
   * When the `Restart` directive is specified, the supervisor will delay the restart
   * using an exponential back off strategy (bounded by minBackoff and maxBackoff).
   *
   * This supervisor is intended to be transparent to both the child actor and external actors.
   * Where external actors can send messages to the supervisor as if it was the child and the
   * messages will be forwarded. And when the child is `Terminated`, the supervisor is also
   * `Terminated`.
   * Transparent to the child means that the child does not have to be aware that it is being
   * supervised specifically by this actor. Just like it does
   * not need to know when it is being supervised by the usual implicit supervisors.
   * The only caveat is that the `ActorRef` of the child is not stable, so any user storing the
   * `sender()` `ActorRef` from the child response may eventually not be able to communicate with
   * the stored `ActorRef`. In general all messages to the child should be directed through this actor.
   *
   * An example of where this supervisor might be used is when you may have an actor that is
   * responsible for continuously polling on a server for some resource that sometimes may be down.
   * Instead of hammering the server continuously when the resource is unavailable, the actor will
   * be restarted with an exponentially increasing back off until the resource is available again.
   *
   * '''***
   * This supervisor should not be used with `Akka Persistence` child actors.
   * `Akka Persistence` actors shutdown unconditionally on `persistFailure()`s rather
   * than throw an exception on a failure like normal actors.

   *
   * This actor can be used to supervise a child actor and start it again
   * after a back-off duration if the child actor is stopped.
   *
   * This is useful in situations where the re-start of the child actor should be
   * delayed e.g. in order to give an external resource time to recover before the
   * child actor tries contacting it again (after being restarted).
   *
   * Specifically this pattern is useful for persistent actors,
   * which are stopped in case of persistence failures.
   * Just restarting them immediately would probably fail again (since the data
   * store is probably unavailable). It is better to try again after a delay.
   *
   * It supports exponential back-off between the given `minBackoff` and
   * `maxBackoff` durations. For example, if `minBackoff` is 3 seconds and
   * `maxBackoff` 30 seconds the start attempts will be delayed with
   * 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 30 seconds. The exponential back-off counter is reset
   * if the actor is not terminated within the `minBackoff` duration.
   *
   * In addition to the calculated exponential back-off an additional
   * random delay based the given `randomFactor` is added, e.g. 0.2 adds up to 20%
   * delay. The reason for adding a random delay is to avoid that all failing
   * actors hit the backend resource at the same time.
   *
   * You can retrieve the current child `ActorRef` by sending `BackoffSupervisor.GetCurrentChild`
   * message to this actor and it will reply with [[akka.pattern.BackoffSupervisor.CurrentChild]]
   * containing the `ActorRef` of the current child, if any.
   *
   * The `BackoffSupervisor`delegates all messages from the child to the parent of the
   * `BackoffSupervisor`, with the supervisor as sender.
   *
   * The `BackoffSupervisor` forwards all other messages to the child, if it is currently running.
   *
   * The child can stop itself and send a [[akka.actor.PoisonPill]] to the parent supervisor
   * if it wants to do an intentional stop.
   *
   * Exceptions in the child are handled with the default supervisionStrategy, which can be changed by using
   * [[BackoffOptions#withSupervisorStrategy]] or [[BackoffOptions#withDefaultStoppingStrategy]]. A
   * `Restart` will perform a normal immediate restart of the child. A `Stop` will
   * stop the child, but it will be started again after the back-off duration.
   *
   * @param childProps   the [[akka.actor.Props]] of the child actor that
   *                     will be started and supervised
   * @param childName    name of the child actor
   * @param minBackoff   minimum (initial) duration until the child actor will
   *                     started again, if it is terminated
   * @param maxBackoff   the exponential back-off is capped to this duration
   * @param randomFactor after calculation of the exponential back-off an additional
   *                     random delay based on this factor is added, e.g. `0.2` adds up to `20%` delay.
   *                     In order to skip this additional delay pass in `0`.

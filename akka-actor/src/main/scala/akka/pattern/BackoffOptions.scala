   * Back-off options for creating a back-off supervisor actor that expects a child actor to restart on failure.
   *
   * This explicit supervisor behaves similarly to the normal implicit supervision where
   * if an actor throws an exception, the decider on the supervisor will decide when to
   * `Stop`, `Restart`, `Escalate`, `Resume` the child actor.
   *
   * When the `Restart` directive is specified, the supervisor will delay the restart
   * using an exponential back off strategy (bounded by minBackoff and maxBackoff).
   *
   * This supervisor is intended to be transparent to both the child actor and external actors.
   * Where external actors can send messages to the supervisor as if it was the child and the
   * messages will be forwarded. And when the child is `Terminated`, the supervisor is also
   * `Terminated`.
   * Transparent to the child means that the child does not have to be aware that it is being
   * supervised specifically by this actor. Just like it does
   * not need to know when it is being supervised by the usual implicit supervisors.
   * The only caveat is that the `ActorRef` of the child is not stable, so any user storing the
   * `sender()` `ActorRef` from the child response may eventually not be able to communicate with
   * the stored `ActorRef`. In general all messages to the child should be directed through this actor.
   *
   * An example of where this supervisor might be used is when you may have an actor that is
   * responsible for continuously polling on a server for some resource that sometimes may be down.
   * Instead of hammering the server continuously when the resource is unavailable, the actor will
   * be restarted with an exponentially increasing back off until the resource is available again.
   *
   * '''***
   * This supervisor should not be used with `Akka Persistence` child actors.
   * `Akka Persistence` actors shutdown unconditionally on `persistFailure()`s rather
   * than throw an exception on a failure like normal actors.
   * [[#onStop]] should be used instead for cases where the child actor
   * terminates itself as a failure signal instead of the normal behavior of throwing an exception.

   * This actor can be used to supervise a child actor and start it again

   * `maxBackoff` 30 seconds the start attempts will be delayed with
   * 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 30 seconds. The exponential back-off counter is reset
   * if the actor is not terminated within the `minBackoff` duration.
   *
   * In addition to the calculated exponential back-off an additional

   * delay. The reason for adding a random delay is to avoid that all failing
   * actors hit the backend resource at the same time.
   *
   * You can retrieve the current child `ActorRef` by sending `BackoffSupervisor.GetCurrentChild`
   * message to this actor and it will reply with [[akka.pattern.BackoffSupervisor.CurrentChild]]

   *
   * The child can stop itself and send a [[akka.actor.PoisonPill]] to the parent supervisor

   *
   * Exceptions in the child are handled with the default supervisionStrategy, which can be changed by using
   * [[BackoffOnStopOptions#withSupervisorStrategy]] or [[BackoffOnStopOptions#withDefaultStoppingStrategy]]. A

  /**
   * Returns a [[scala.concurrent.Future]] that will be completed with success (value `true`) when
   * existing messages of the target actor has been processed and the actor has been
   * terminated.
   *
   * Useful when you need to wait for termination or compose ordered termination of several actors,
   * which should only be done outside of the ActorSystem as blocking inside Actors is discouraged.
   *
   * <b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b> the actor being terminated and its supervisor
   * being informed of the availability of the deceased actor’s name are two
   * distinct operations, which do not obey any reliable ordering. Especially
   * the following will NOT work:
   *
   * {{{
   * def receive = {
   *   case msg =>
   *     Await.result(gracefulStop(someChild, timeout), timeout)
   *     context.actorOf(Props(...), "someChild") // assuming that that was someChild’s name, this will NOT work
   * }
   * }}}
   *
   * If the target actor isn't terminated within the timeout the [[scala.concurrent.Future]]
   * is completed with failure [[akka.pattern.AskTimeoutException]].
   *
   * If you want to invoke specialized stopping logic on your target actor instead of PoisonPill, you can pass your
   * stop command as a parameter:
   * {{{
   *   gracefulStop(someChild, timeout, MyStopGracefullyMessage).onComplete {
   *      // Do something after someChild being stopped
   *   }
   * }}}

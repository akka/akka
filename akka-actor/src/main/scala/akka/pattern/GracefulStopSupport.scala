   * Useful when you need to wait for termination or compose ordered termination of several actors,
   * which should only be done outside of the ActorSystem as blocking inside Actors is discouraged.
   *
   * <b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b> the actor being terminated and its supervisor
   * being informed of the availability of the deceased actor’s name are two

   * If the target actor isn't terminated within the timeout the [[akka.dispatch.Future]]

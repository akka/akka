/**
 * This actor can be used to supervise a child actor and start it again
 * after a back-off duration if the child actor is stopped.
 *
 * This is useful in situations where the re-start of the child actor should be
 * delayed e.g. in order to give an external resource time to recover before the
 * child actor tries contacting it again (after being restarted).
 *
 * Specifically this pattern is useful for for persistent actors,
 * which are stopped in case of persistence failures.
 * Just restarting them immediately would probably fail again (since the data
 * store is probably unavailable). It is better to try again after a delay.
 *
 * It supports exponential back-off between the given `minBackoff` and
 * `maxBackoff` durations. For example, if `minBackoff` is 3 seconds and
 * `maxBackoff` 30 seconds the start attempts will be delayed with
 * 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 30 seconds. The exponential back-off counter is reset
 * if the actor is not terminated within the `minBackoff` duration.
 *
 * In addition to the calculated exponential back-off an additional
 * random delay based the given `randomFactor` is added, e.g. 0.2 adds up to 20%
 * delay. The reason for adding a random delay is to avoid that all failing
 * actors hit the backend resource at the same time.
 *
 * You can retrieve the current child `ActorRef` by sending `BackoffSupervisor.GetCurrentChild`
 * message to this actor and it will reply with [[akka.pattern.BackoffSupervisor.CurrentChild]]
 * containing the `ActorRef` of the current child, if any.
 *
 * The `BackoffSupervisor` forwards all messages from the child to the parent of the
 * `BackoffSupervisor`.
 *
 * The `BackoffSupervisor` forwards all other messages to the child, if it is currently running.
 *
 * The child can stop itself and send a [[akka.actor.PoisonPill]] to the parent supervisor
 * if it wants to do an intentional stop.
 *
 * Exceptions in the child are handled with the given `supervisionStrategy`. A
 * `Restart` will perform a normal immediate restart of the child. A `Stop` will
 * stop the child, but it will be started again after the back-off duration.

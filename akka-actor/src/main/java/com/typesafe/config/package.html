<p>
An API for loading and using configuration files, see <a href="https://github.com/havocp/config/">the project site</a>
for more information.
</p>

<p>
Typically you would load configuration with a static method from {@link com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory} and then use
it with methods in the {@link com.typesafe.config.Config} interface.
</p>

<p>
An application can simply call {@link com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory#load()} and place
its configuration in "application.conf" on the classpath.
If you use the default configuration from {@link com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory#load()}
there's no need to pass a configuration to your libraries
and frameworks, as long as they all default to this same default, which they should.
</p>

<p>
A library or framework should ship a file "reference.conf" in its jar, and allow an application to pass in a
{@link com.typesafe.config.Config} to be used for the library. If no {@link com.typesafe.config.Config} is provided,
call {@link com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory#load()}
to get the default one. Typically a library might offer two constructors, one with a <code>Config</code> parameter
and one which uses {@link com.typesafe.config.ConfigFactory#load()}.
</p>

<p>
You can find an example app and library <a href="https://github.com/havocp/config/tree/master/examples">on GitHub</a>.

/**
 * This class holds some static factory methods for building ConfigValue. See
 * also ConfigFactory which has methods for parsing files and certain in-memory
 * data structures.
 */
public final class ConfigValueFactory {
    /**
     * Creates a ConfigValue from a plain Java boxed value, which may be a
     * Boolean, Number, String, Map, Iterable, or null. A Map must be a Map from
     * String to more values that can be supplied to fromAnyRef(). An Iterable
     * must iterate over more values that can be supplied to fromAnyRef(). A Map
     * will become a ConfigObject and an Iterable will become a ConfigList. If
     * the Iterable is not an ordered collection, results could be strange,
     * since ConfigList is ordered.
     *
     * In a Map passed to fromAnyRef(), the map's keys are plain keys, not path
     * expressions. So if your Map has a key "foo.bar" then you will get one
     * object with a key called "foo.bar", rather than an object with a key
     * "foo" containing another object with a key "bar".
     *
     * The originDescription will be used to set the origin() field on the
     * ConfigValue. It should normally be the name of the file the values came
     * from, or something short describing the value such as "default settings".
     * The originDescription is prefixed to error messages so users can tell
     * where problematic values are coming from.
     *
     * Supplying the result of ConfigValue.unwrapped() to this function is
     * guaranteed to work and should give you back a ConfigValue that matches
     * the one you unwrapped. The re-wrapped ConfigValue will lose some
     * information that was present in the original such as its origin, but it
     * will have matching values.
     *
     * This function throws if you supply a value that cannot be converted to a
     * ConfigValue, but supplying such a value is a bug in your program, so you
     * should never handle the exception. Just fix your program (or report a bug
     * against this library).
     *
     * @param object
     *            object to convert to ConfigValue
     * @param originDescription

     * @return a new value

     * wrapped in ConfigValue. To get nested ConfigObject, some of the values in
     * the map would have to be more maps.

/**
 * An Akka scheduler service. This one needs one special behavior: if Closeable, it MUST execute all
 * outstanding tasks upon .close() in order to properly shutdown all dispatchers.
 *
 * <p>Furthermore, this timer service MUST throw IllegalStateException if it cannot schedule a task.
 * Once scheduled, the task MUST be executed. If executed upon close(), the task may execute before
 * its timeout.
 *
 * <p>Scheduler implementation are loaded reflectively at ActorSystem start-up with the following
 * constructor arguments: 1) the systemâ€™s com.typesafe.config.Config (from system.settings.config)
 * 2) a akka.event.LoggingAdapter 3) a java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory

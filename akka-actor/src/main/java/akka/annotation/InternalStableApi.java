/**
 * Marks APIs that are considered internal to Akka and should not be accessed by user code but that
 * are used across Akka project boundaries and therefore shouldn't be changed without considering
 * possible usage outside of the Akka core modules.
 *
 * <p>If a method/class annotated with this annotation is part of a public API and has the Scala
 * {@code private[akka]} access restriction, which leads to a public method from Java, there should
 * be a javadoc/scaladoc comment where the first line MUST include {@code INTERNAL API} in order to
 * be easily identifiable from generated documentation. Additional information may be put on the
 * same line as the INTERNAL API comment in order to clarify further.

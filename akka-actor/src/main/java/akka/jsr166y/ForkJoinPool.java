/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} for running {@link ForkJoinTask}s.
 * A {@code ForkJoinPool} provides the entry point for submissions
 * from non-{@code ForkJoinTask} clients, as well as management and
 * monitoring operations.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} differs from other kinds of {@link
 * ExecutorService} mainly by virtue of employing
 * <em>work-stealing</em>: all threads in the pool attempt to find and
 * execute tasks submitted to the pool and/or created by other active
 * tasks (eventually blocking waiting for work if none exist). This
 * enables efficient processing when most tasks spawn other subtasks
 * (as do most {@code ForkJoinTask}s), as well as when many small
 * tasks are submitted to the pool from external clients.  Especially
 * when setting <em>asyncMode</em> to true in constructors, {@code
 * ForkJoinPool}s may also be appropriate for use with event-style
 * tasks that are never joined.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} is constructed with a given target
 * parallelism level; by default, equal to the number of available
 * processors. The pool attempts to maintain enough active (or
 * available) threads by dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming
 * internal worker threads, even if some tasks are stalled waiting to
 * join others. However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the
 * face of blocked IO or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested
 * {@link ManagedBlocker} interface enables extension of the kinds of
 * synchronization accommodated.
 *
 * <p>In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this
 * class provides status check methods (for example
 * {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing,
 * tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method
 * {@link #toString} returns indications of pool state in a
 * convenient form for informal monitoring.
 *
 * <p> As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three
 * main task execution methods summarized in the following table.
 * These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already
 * engaged in fork/join computations in the current pool.  The main
 * forms of these methods accept instances of {@code ForkJoinTask},
 * but overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain {@code
 * Runnable}- or {@code Callable}- based activities as well.  However,
 * tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally instead
 * use the within-computation forms listed in the table unless using
 * async event-style tasks that are not usually joined, in which case
 * there is little difference among choice of methods.

    /*
     * Implementation Overview
     *
     * This class and its nested classes provide the main
     * functionality and control for a set of worker threads:
     * Submissions from non-FJ threads enter into submission queues.
     * Workers take these tasks and typically split them into subtasks
     * that may be stolen by other workers.  Preference rules give
     * first priority to processing tasks from their own queues (LIFO
     * or FIFO, depending on mode), then to randomized FIFO steals of
     * tasks in other queues.
     *
     * WorkQueues
     * ==========
     *
     * Most operations occur within work-stealing queues (in nested
     * class WorkQueue).  These are special forms of Deques that
     * support only three of the four possible end-operations -- push,
     * pop, and poll (aka steal), under the further constraints that
     * push and pop are called only from the owning thread (or, as
     * extended here, under a lock), while poll may be called from
     * other threads.  (If you are unfamiliar with them, you probably
     * want to read Herlihy and Shavit's book "The Art of
     * Multiprocessor programming", chapter 16 describing these in
     * more detail before proceeding.)  The main work-stealing queue
     * design is roughly similar to those in the papers "Dynamic
     * Circular Work-Stealing Deque" by Chase and Lev, SPAA 2005
     * (http://research.sun.com/scalable/pubs/index.html) and
     * "Idempotent work stealing" by Michael, Saraswat, and Vechev,
     * PPoPP 2009 (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1504186).
     * The main differences ultimately stem from GC requirements that
     * we null out taken slots as soon as we can, to maintain as small
     * a footprint as possible even in programs generating huge
     * numbers of tasks. To accomplish this, we shift the CAS
     * arbitrating pop vs poll (steal) from being on the indices
     * ("base" and "top") to the slots themselves.  So, both a
     * successful pop and poll mainly entail a CAS of a slot from
     * non-null to null.  Because we rely on CASes of references, we
     * do not need tag bits on base or top.  They are simple ints as
     * used in any circular array-based queue (see for example
     * ArrayDeque).  Updates to the indices must still be ordered in a
     * way that guarantees that top == base means the queue is empty,
     * but otherwise may err on the side of possibly making the queue
     * appear nonempty when a push, pop, or poll have not fully
     * committed. Note that this means that the poll operation,
     * considered individually, is not wait-free. One thief cannot
     * successfully continue until another in-progress one (or, if
     * previously empty, a push) completes.  However, in the
     * aggregate, we ensure at least probabilistic non-blockingness.
     * If an attempted steal fails, a thief always chooses a different
     * random victim target to try next. So, in order for one thief to
     * progress, it suffices for any in-progress poll or new push on
     * any empty queue to complete.
     *
     * This approach also enables support of a user mode in which local
     * task processing is in FIFO, not LIFO order, simply by using
     * poll rather than pop.  This can be useful in message-passing
     * frameworks in which tasks are never joined.  However neither
     * mode considers affinities, loads, cache localities, etc, so
     * rarely provide the best possible performance on a given
     * machine, but portably provide good throughput by averaging over
     * these factors.  (Further, even if we did try to use such
     * information, we do not usually have a basis for exploiting it.
     * For example, some sets of tasks profit from cache affinities,
     * but others are harmed by cache pollution effects.)
     *
     * WorkQueues are also used in a similar way for tasks submitted
     * to the pool. We cannot mix these tasks in the same queues used
     * for work-stealing (this would contaminate lifo/fifo
     * processing). Instead, we loosely associate submission queues
     * with submitting threads, using a form of hashing.  The
     * ThreadLocal Submitter class contains a value initially used as
     * a hash code for choosing existing queues, but may be randomly
     * repositioned upon contention with other submitters.  In
     * essence, submitters act like workers except that they never
     * take tasks, and they are multiplexed on to a finite number of
     * shared work queues. However, classes are set up so that future
     * extensions could allow submitters to optionally help perform
     * tasks as well. Insertion of tasks in shared mode requires a
     * lock (mainly to protect in the case of resizing) but we use
     * only a simple spinlock (using bits in field runState), because
     * submitters encountering a busy queue move on to try or create
     * other queues, so never block.
     *
     * Management
     * ==========
     *
     * The main throughput advantages of work-stealing stem from
     * decentralized control -- workers mostly take tasks from
     * themselves or each other. We cannot negate this in the
     * implementation of other management responsibilities. The main
     * tactic for avoiding bottlenecks is packing nearly all
     * essentially atomic control state into two volatile variables
     * that are by far most often read (not written) as status and
     * consistency checks.
     *
     * Field "ctl" contains 64 bits holding all the information needed
     * to atomically decide to add, inactivate, enqueue (on an event
     * queue), dequeue, and/or re-activate workers.  To enable this
     * packing, we restrict maximum parallelism to (1<<15)-1 (which is
     * far in excess of normal operating range) to allow ids, counts,
     * and their negations (used for thresholding) to fit into 16bit
     * fields.
     *
     * Field "runState" contains 32 bits needed to register and
     * deregister WorkQueues, as well as to enable shutdown. It is
     * only modified under a lock (normally briefly held, but
     * occasionally protecting allocations and resizings) but even
     * when locked remains available to check consistency. An
     * auxiliary field "growHints", also only modified under lock,
     * contains a candidate index for the next WorkQueue and
     * a mask for submission queue indices.
     *
     * Recording WorkQueues.  WorkQueues are recorded in the
     * "workQueues" array that is created upon pool construction and
     * expanded if necessary.  Updates to the array while recording
     * new workers and unrecording terminated ones are protected from
     * each other by a lock but the array is otherwise concurrently
     * readable, and accessed directly.  To simplify index-based
     * operations, the array size is always a power of two, and all
     * readers must tolerate null slots. Shared (submission) queues
     * are at even indices, worker queues at odd indices. Grouping
     * them together in this way simplifies and speeds up task
     * scanning. To avoid flailing during start-up, the array is
     * presized to hold twice #parallelism workers (which is unlikely
     * to need further resizing during execution). But to avoid
     * dealing with so many null slots, variable runState includes a
     * mask for the nearest power of two that contains all currently
     * used indices.
     *
     * All worker thread creation is on-demand, triggered by task
     * submissions, replacement of terminated workers, and/or
     * compensation for blocked workers. However, all other support
     * code is set up to work with other policies.  To ensure that we
     * do not hold on to worker references that would prevent GC, ALL
     * accesses to workQueues are via indices into the workQueues
     * array (which is one source of some of the messy code
     * constructions here). In essence, the workQueues array serves as
     * a weak reference mechanism. Thus for example the wait queue
     * field of ctl stores indices, not references.  Access to the
     * workQueues in associated methods (for example signalWork) must
     * both index-check and null-check the IDs. All such accesses
     * ignore bad IDs by returning out early from what they are doing,
     * since this can only be associated with termination, in which
     * case it is OK to give up.  All uses of the workQueues array
     * also check that it is non-null (even if previously
     * non-null). This allows nulling during termination, which is
     * currently not necessary, but remains an option for
     * resource-revocation-based shutdown schemes. It also helps
     * reduce JIT issuance of uncommon-trap code, which tends to
     * unnecessarily complicate control flow in some methods.
     *
     * Event Queuing. Unlike HPC work-stealing frameworks, we cannot
     * let workers spin indefinitely scanning for tasks when none can
     * be found immediately, and we cannot start/resume workers unless
     * there appear to be tasks available.  On the other hand, we must
     * quickly prod them into action when new tasks are submitted or
     * generated. In many usages, ramp-up time to activate workers is
     * the main limiting factor in overall performance (this is
     * compounded at program start-up by JIT compilation and
     * allocation). So we try to streamline this as much as possible.
     * We park/unpark workers after placing in an event wait queue
     * when they cannot find work. This "queue" is actually a simple
     * Treiber stack, headed by the "id" field of ctl, plus a 15bit
     * counter value (that reflects the number of times a worker has
     * been inactivated) to avoid ABA effects (we need only as many
     * version numbers as worker threads). Successors are held in
     * field WorkQueue.nextWait.  Queuing deals with several intrinsic
     * races, mainly that a task-producing thread can miss seeing (and
     * signalling) another thread that gave up looking for work but
     * has not yet entered the wait queue. We solve this by requiring
     * a full sweep of all workers (via repeated calls to method
     * scan()) both before and after a newly waiting worker is added
     * to the wait queue. During a rescan, the worker might release
     * some other queued worker rather than itself, which has the same
     * net effect. Because enqueued workers may actually be rescanning
     * rather than waiting, we set and clear the "parker" field of
     * WorkQueues to reduce unnecessary calls to unpark.  (This
     * requires a secondary recheck to avoid missed signals.)  Note
     * the unusual conventions about Thread.interrupts surrounding
     * parking and other blocking: Because interrupts are used solely
     * to alert threads to check termination, which is checked anyway
     * upon blocking, we clear status (using Thread.interrupted)
     * before any call to park, so that park does not immediately
     * return due to status being set via some other unrelated call to
     * interrupt in user code.
     *
     * Signalling.  We create or wake up workers only when there
     * appears to be at least one task they might be able to find and
     * execute.  When a submission is added or another worker adds a
     * task to a queue that previously had fewer than two tasks, they
     * signal waiting workers (or trigger creation of new ones if
     * fewer than the given parallelism level -- see signalWork).
     * These primary signals are buttressed by signals during rescans;
     * together these cover the signals needed in cases when more
     * tasks are pushed but untaken, and improve performance compared
     * to having one thread wake up all workers.
     *
     * Trimming workers. To release resources after periods of lack of
     * use, a worker starting to wait when the pool is quiescent will
     * time out and terminate if the pool has remained quiescent for
     * SHRINK_RATE nanosecs. This will slowly propagate, eventually
     * terminating all workers after long periods of non-use.
     *
     * Shutdown and Termination. A call to shutdownNow atomically sets
     * a runState bit and then (non-atomically) sets each worker's
     * runState status, cancels all unprocessed tasks, and wakes up
     * all waiting workers.  Detecting whether termination should
     * commence after a non-abrupt shutdown() call requires more work
     * and bookkeeping. We need consensus about quiescence (i.e., that
     * there is no more work). The active count provides a primary
     * indication but non-abrupt shutdown still requires a rechecking
     * scan for any workers that are inactive but not queued.
     *
     * Joining Tasks
     * =============
     *
     * Any of several actions may be taken when one worker is waiting
     * to join a task stolen (or always held) by another.  Because we
     * are multiplexing many tasks on to a pool of workers, we can't
     * just let them block (as in Thread.join).  We also cannot just
     * reassign the joiner's run-time stack with another and replace
     * it later, which would be a form of "continuation", that even if
     * possible is not necessarily a good idea since we sometimes need
     * both an unblocked task and its continuation to progress.
     * Instead we combine two tactics:
     *
     *   Helping: Arranging for the joiner to execute some task that it
     *      would be running if the steal had not occurred.
     *
     *   Compensating: Unless there are already enough live threads,
     *      method tryCompensate() may create or re-activate a spare
     *      thread to compensate for blocked joiners until they unblock.
     *
     * A third form (implemented in tryRemoveAndExec and
     * tryPollForAndExec) amounts to helping a hypothetical
     * compensator: If we can readily tell that a possible action of a
     * compensator is to steal and execute the task being joined, the
     * joining thread can do so directly, without the need for a
     * compensation thread (although at the expense of larger run-time
     * stacks, but the tradeoff is typically worthwhile).
     *
     * The ManagedBlocker extension API can't use helping so relies
     * only on compensation in method awaitBlocker.
     *
     * The algorithm in tryHelpStealer entails a form of "linear"
     * helping: Each worker records (in field currentSteal) the most
     * recent task it stole from some other worker. Plus, it records
     * (in field currentJoin) the task it is currently actively
     * joining. Method tryHelpStealer uses these markers to try to
     * find a worker to help (i.e., steal back a task from and execute
     * it) that could hasten completion of the actively joined task.
     * In essence, the joiner executes a task that would be on its own
     * local deque had the to-be-joined task not been stolen. This may
     * be seen as a conservative variant of the approach in Wagner &
     * Calder "Leapfrogging: a portable technique for implementing
     * efficient futures" SIGPLAN Notices, 1993
     * (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155354). It differs in
     * that: (1) We only maintain dependency links across workers upon
     * steals, rather than use per-task bookkeeping.  This sometimes
     * requires a linear scan of workQueues array to locate stealers, but
     * often doesn't because stealers leave hints (that may become
     * stale/wrong) of where to locate them.  A stealHint is only a
     * hint because a worker might have had multiple steals and the
     * hint records only one of them (usually the most current).
     * Hinting isolates cost to when it is needed, rather than adding
     * to per-task overhead.  (2) It is "shallow", ignoring nesting
     * and potentially cyclic mutual steals.  (3) It is intentionally
     * racy: field currentJoin is updated only while actively joining,
     * which means that we miss links in the chain during long-lived
     * tasks, GC stalls etc (which is OK since blocking in such cases
     * is usually a good idea).  (4) We bound the number of attempts
     * to find work (see MAX_HELP_DEPTH) and fall back to suspending
     * the worker and if necessary replacing it with another.
     *
     * It is impossible to keep exactly the target parallelism number
     * of threads running at any given time.  Determining the
     * existence of conservatively safe helping targets, the
     * availability of already-created spares, and the apparent need
     * to create new spares are all racy, so we rely on multiple
     * retries of each.  Currently, in keeping with on-demand
     * signalling policy, we compensate only if blocking would leave
     * less than one active (non-waiting, non-blocked) worker.
     * Additionally, to avoid some false alarms due to GC, lagging
     * counters, system activity, etc, compensated blocking for joins
     * is only attempted after rechecks stabilize in
     * ForkJoinTask.awaitJoin. (Retries are interspersed with
     * Thread.yield, for good citizenship.)
     *
     * Style notes: There is a lot of representation-level coupling
     * among classes ForkJoinPool, ForkJoinWorkerThread, and
     * ForkJoinTask.  The fields of WorkQueue maintain data structures
     * managed by ForkJoinPool, so are directly accessed.  There is
     * little point trying to reduce this, since any associated future
     * changes in representations will need to be accompanied by
     * algorithmic changes anyway. Several methods intrinsically
     * sprawl because they must accumulate sets of consistent reads of
     * volatiles held in local variables.  Methods signalWork() and
     * scan() are the main bottlenecks, so are especially heavily
     * micro-optimized/mangled.  There are lots of inline assignments
     * (of form "while ((local = field) != 0)") which are usually the
     * simplest way to ensure the required read orderings (which are
     * sometimes critical). This leads to a "C"-like style of listing
     * declarations of these locals at the heads of methods or blocks.
     * There are several occurrences of the unusual "do {} while
     * (!cas...)"  which is the simplest way to force an update of a
     * CAS'ed variable. There are also other coding oddities that help
     * some methods perform reasonably even when interpreted (not
     * compiled).
     *
     * The order of declarations in this file is:
     * (1) Static utility functions
     * (2) Nested (static) classes
     * (3) Static fields
     * (4) Fields, along with constants used when unpacking some of them
     * (5) Internal control methods
     * (6) Callbacks and other support for ForkJoinTask methods
     * (7) Exported methods
     * (8) Static block initializing statics in minimally dependent order

    /**
     * Queues supporting work-stealing as well as external task
     * submission. See above for main rationale and algorithms.
     * Implementation relies heavily on "Unsafe" intrinsics
     * and selective use of "volatile":
     *
     * Field "base" is the index (mod array.length) of the least valid
     * queue slot, which is always the next position to steal (poll)
     * from if nonempty. Reads and writes require volatile orderings
     * but not CAS, because updates are only performed after slot
     * CASes.
     *
     * Field "top" is the index (mod array.length) of the next queue
     * slot to push to or pop from. It is written only by owner thread
     * for push, or under lock for trySharedPush, and accessed by
     * other threads only after reading (volatile) base.  Both top and
     * base are allowed to wrap around on overflow, but (top - base)
     * (or more commonly -(base - top) to force volatile read of base
     * before top) still estimates size.
     *
     * The array slots are read and written using the emulation of
     * volatiles/atomics provided by Unsafe. Insertions must in
     * general use putOrderedObject as a form of releasing store to
     * ensure that all writes to the task object are ordered before
     * its publication in the queue. (Although we can avoid one case
     * of this when locked in trySharedPush.) All removals entail a
     * CAS to null.  The array is always a power of two. To ensure
     * safety of Unsafe array operations, all accesses perform
     * explicit null checks and implicit bounds checks via
     * power-of-two masking.
     *
     * In addition to basic queuing support, this class contains
     * fields described elsewhere to control execution. It turns out
     * to work better memory-layout-wise to include them in this
     * class rather than a separate class.
     *
     * Performance on most platforms is very sensitive to placement of
     * instances of both WorkQueues and their arrays -- we absolutely
     * do not want multiple WorkQueue instances or multiple queue
     * arrays sharing cache lines. (It would be best for queue objects
     * and their arrays to share, but there is nothing available to
     * help arrange that).  Unfortunately, because they are recorded
     * in a common array, WorkQueue instances are often moved to be
     * adjacent by garbage collectors. To reduce impact, we use field
     * padding that works OK on common platforms; this effectively
     * trades off slightly slower average field access for the sake of
     * avoiding really bad worst-case access. (Until better JVM
     * support is in place, this padding is dependent on transient
     * properties of JVM field layout rules.)  We also take care in
     * allocating, sizing and resizing the array. Non-shared queue
     * arrays are initialized (via method growArray) by workers before
     * use. Others are allocated on first use.

     * together with id and st. The offsets of counts by the target
     * parallelism and the positionings of fields makes it possible to
     * perform the most common checks via sign tests of fields: When
     * ac is negative, there are not enough active workers, when tc is

     * signed shifts to maintain signedness.
     *
     * When a thread is queued (inactivated), its eventCount field is
     * set negative, which is the only way to tell if a worker is
     * prevented from executing tasks, even though it must continue to
     * scan for them to avoid queuing races. Note however that
     * eventCount updates lag releases so usage requires care.

     * SHUTDOWN: true if shutdown is enabled (1 bit)
     * SEQ:  a sequence number updated upon (de)registering workers (15 bits)
     * MASK: mask (power of 2 - 1) covering all registered poolIndexes (16 bits)

     * The combination of mask and sequence number enables simple
     * consistency checks: Staleness of read-only operations on the
     * workQueues array can be checked by comparing runState before vs
     * after the reads. The low 16 bits (i.e, anding with SMASK) hold

     * part because it returns upon detecting inconsistencies,
     * contention, or state changes that indicate possible success on
     * re-invocation.
     *
     * The scan searches for tasks across queues, randomly selecting
     * the first #queues probes, favoring steals over submissions
     * (by exploiting even/odd indexing), and then performing a
     * circular sweep of all queues.  The scan terminates upon either
     * finding a non-empty queue, or completing a full sweep. If the
     * worker is not inactivated, it takes and returns a task from
     * this queue.  On failure to find a task, we take one of the
     * following actions, after which the caller will retry calling
     * this method unless terminated.
     *
     * * If pool is terminating, terminate the worker.
     *
     * * If not a complete sweep, try to release a waiting worker.  If
     * the scan terminated because the worker is inactivated, then the
     * released worker will often be the calling worker, and it can
     * succeed obtaining a task on the next call. Or maybe it is
     * another worker, but with same net effect. Releasing in other
     * cases as well ensures that we have enough workers running.
     *
     * * If the caller has run a task since the last empty scan,
     * return (to allow rescan) if other workers are not also yet
     * enqueued.  Field WorkQueue.rescans counts down on each scan to
     * ensure eventual inactivation and blocking.
     *
     * * If not already enqueued, try to inactivate and enqueue the
     * worker on wait queue.
     *
     * * If already enqueued and none of the above apply, either park
     * awaiting signal, or if this is the most recent waiter and pool
     * is quiescent, relay to idleAwaitWork to check for termination
     * and possibly shrink pool.

/**
 * INTERNAL API
 *
 * Optimization for add/remove followed by merge and merge should just fast forward to
 * the new instance.
 *
 * It's like a cache between calls of the same thread, you can think of it as a thread local.
 * The Replicator actor invokes the user's modify function, which returns a new ReplicatedData instance,
 * with the ancestor field set (see for example the add method in ORSet). Then (in same thread) the
 * Replication calls merge, which makes use of the ancestor field to perform quick merge
 * (see for example merge method in ORSet).
 *
 * It's not thread safe if the modifying function and merge are called from different threads,
 * i.e. if used outside the Replicator infrastructure, but the worst thing that can happen is that
 * a full merge is performed instead of the fast forward merge.

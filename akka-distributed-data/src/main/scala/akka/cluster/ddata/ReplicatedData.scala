/**
 * Interface for implementing a state based convergent
 * replicated data type (CvRDT).
 *
 * ReplicatedData types must be serializable with an Akka
 * Serializer. It is highly recommended to implement a serializer with
 * Protobuf or similar. The built in data types are marked with
 * [[ReplicatedDataSerialization]] and serialized with
 * [[akka.cluster.ddata.protobuf.ReplicatedDataSerializer]].
 *
 * Serialization of the data types are used in remote messages and also
 * for creating message digests (SHA-1) to detect changes. Therefore it is
 * important that the serialization produce the same bytes for the same content.
 * For example sets and maps should be sorted deterministically in the serialization.
 *
 * ReplicatedData types should be immutable, i.e. "modifying" methods should return
 * a new instance.

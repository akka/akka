Module stability: **SOLID**

The Typed Actors are implemented through `Typed Actors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_object>`_. It uses AOP through `AspectWerkz <http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/>`_ to turn regular POJOs into asynchronous non-blocking Actors with semantics of the Actor Model. Each method dispatch is turned into a message that is put on a queue to be processed by the Typed Actor sequentially one by one.

If you are using the `Spring Framework <http://springsource.org>`_ then take a look at Akka's `Spring integration <spring-integration>`_.

**WARNING:** Do not configure to use a ``WorkStealingDispatcher`` with your ``TypedActors``, it just isn't safe with how ``TypedActors`` currently are implemented. This limitation will most likely be removed in the future.

Creating Typed Actors
---------------------

**IMPORTANT:** The Typed Actors class must have access modifier 'public' (which is default) and can't be an inner class (unless it is an inner class in an 'object').

Akka turns POJOs with interface and implementation into asynchronous (Typed) Actors. Akka is using `AspectWerkz’s Proxy <http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/jboner/archives/000914_awproxy_proxy_on_steriods.html>`_ implementation, which is the `most performant <http://docs.codehaus.org/display/AW/AOP+Benchmark>`_ proxy implementation there exists.

In order to create a Typed Actor you have to subclass the ``TypedActor`` base class.

Here is an example.

If you have a POJO with an interface implementation separation like this:

.. code-block:: scala

  import akka.actor.TypedActor

  trait RegistrationService {
    def register(user: User, cred: Credentials): Unit
    def getUserFor(username: String): User
  }

.. code-block:: scala

  public class RegistrationServiceImpl extends TypedActor with RegistrationService {
    def register(user: User, cred: Credentials) {
      ... // register user
    }

    def getUserFor(username: String): User = {
      ... // fetch user by username
     user
    }
  }

Then you can create an Typed Actor out of it by creating it through the ``TypedActor`` factory like this:

.. code-block:: scala

  val service = TypedActor.newInstance(classOf[RegistrationService], classOf[RegistrationServiceImpl], 1000)
  // The last parameter defines the timeout for Future calls

Creating Typed Actors with non-default constructor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a typed actor that takes constructor arguments use a variant of ``newInstance`` or ``newRemoteInstance`` that takes a call-by-name block in which you can create the Typed Actor in any way you like.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: scala

  val service = TypedActor.newInstance(classOf[Service], new ServiceWithConstructorArgs("someString", 500L))

Configuration factory class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using a configuration object:

.. code-block:: scala

  import akka.actor.TypedActorConfiguration
  import akka.util.Duration
  import akka.util.duration._

      val config = TypedActorConfiguration()
        .timeout(3000 millis)

  val service = TypedActor.newInstance(classOf[RegistrationService], classOf[RegistrationServiceImpl], config)

However, often you will not use these factory methods but declaratively define the Typed Actors as part of a supervisor hierarchy. More on that in the :ref:`fault-tolerance-scala` section.

Sending messages
----------------

Messages are sent simply by invoking methods on the POJO, which is proxy to the "real" POJO now. The arguments to the method are bundled up atomically into an message and sent to the receiver (the actual POJO instance).

One-way message send
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Methods that return void are turned into ‘fire-and-forget’ semantics by asynchronously firing off the message and return immediately. In the example above it would be the 'register' method, so if this method is invoked then it returns immediately:

.. code-block:: java

  // method invocation returns immediately and method is invoke asynchronously using the Actor Model semantics
  service.register(user, creds)

Request-reply message send
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Methods that return something (e.g. non-void methods) are turned into ‘send-and-receive-eventually’ semantics by asynchronously firing off the message and wait on the reply using a Future.

.. code-block:: scala

  // method invocation is asynchronously dispatched using the Actor Model semantics,
  // but it blocks waiting on a Future to be resolved in the background
  val user = service.getUser(username)

Generally it is preferred to use fire-forget messages as much as possible since they will never block, e.g. consume a resource by waiting. But sometimes they are neat to use since they:

* Simulates standard Java method dispatch, which is more intuitive for most Java developers
* Are a neat to model request-reply
* Are useful when you need to do things in a defined order

Request-reply-with-future message send
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Methods that return a ``akka.dispatch.Future<TYPE>`` are turned into ‘send-and-receive-with-future’ semantics by asynchronously firing off the message and returns immediately with a Future. You need to use the ``future(...)`` method in the ``TypedActor`` base class to resolve the Future that the client code is waiting on.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: scala

  class MathTypedActorImpl extends TypedActor with MathTypedActor {
    def square(x: Int): Future[Integer] = future(x * x)
  }

  // create the ping actor
  val math = TypedActor.newInstance(classOf[MathTyped], classOf[MathTypedImpl])

  // This method will return immediately when called, caller should wait on the Future for the result
  val future = math.square(10)
  future.await
  val result: Int = future.get

Stopping Typed Actors
---------------------

Once Typed Actors have been created with one of the ``TypedActor.newInstance`` methods they need to be stopped with ``TypedActor.stop`` to free resources allocated by the created Typed Actor (this is not needed when the Typed Actor is supervised).

.. code-block:: scala

  // Create Typed Actor
  val service = TypedActor.newInstance(classOf[RegistrationService], classOf[RegistrationServiceImpl], 1000)

  // ...

  // Free Typed Actor resources
  TypedActor.stop(service)

When the Typed Actor defines a shutdown callback method (:ref:`fault-tolerance-scala`) it will be invoked on ``TypedActor.stop``.

How to use the TypedActorContext for runtime information access
---------------------------------------------------------------

The ``akka.actor.TypedActorContext`` class Holds 'runtime type information' (RTTI) for the Typed Actor. This context is a member field in the ``TypedActor`` base class and holds for example the current sender reference, the current sender future etc.

Here is an example how you can use it to in a 'void' (e.g. fire-forget) method to implement request-reply by using the sender reference:

.. code-block:: scala

  class PingImpl extends TypedActor with Ping {

    def hit(count: Int) {
      val pong = context.getSender.asInstanceOf[Pong]
      pong.hit(count++)
    }
  }

If the sender, sender future etc. is not available, then these methods will return ``null`` so you should have a way of dealing with that scenario.

Messages and immutability
-------------------------

**IMPORTANT**: Messages can be any kind of object but have to be immutable (there is a workaround, see next section). Java or Scala can’t enforce immutability (yet) so this has to be by convention. Primitives like String, int, Long are always immutable. Apart from these you have to create your own immutable objects to send as messages. If you pass on a reference to an instance that is mutable then this instance can be modified concurrently by two different Typed Actors and the Actor model is broken leaving you with NO guarantees and most likely corrupt data.

Akka can help you in this regard. It allows you to turn on an option for serializing all messages, e.g. all parameters to the Typed Actor effectively making a deep clone/copy of the parameters. This will make sending mutable messages completely safe. This option is turned on in the ‘$AKKA_HOME/config/akka.conf’ config file like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

  akka {
    actor {
      serialize-messages = on  # does a deep clone of messages to ensure immutability
    }
  }

This will make a deep clone (using Java serialization) of all parameters.

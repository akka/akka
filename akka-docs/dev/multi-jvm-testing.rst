 Multi-JVM Testing
###################

Support for running applications (objects with main methods) and
ScalaTest tests in multiple JVMs.


Setup
=====

The multi-JVM testing is an sbt plugin that you can find here:

http://github.com/typesafehub/sbt-multi-jvm

You can add it as a plugin by adding the following to your project/plugins.sbt::

   resolvers += Classpaths.typesafeResolver

   addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbtmultijvm" % "sbt-multi-jvm" % "0.1.9")

You can then add multi-JVM testing to ``project/Build.scala`` by including the ``MultiJvm``
settings and config. For example, here is how the akka-remote project adds
multi-JVM testing::

   import sbt._
   import Keys._
   import com.typesafe.sbtmultijvm.MultiJvmPlugin
   import com.typesafe.sbtmultijvm.MultiJvmPlugin.{ MultiJvm, extraOptions }

   object AkkaBuild extends Build {

     lazy val remote = Project(
       id = "akka-remote",
       base = file("akka-remote"),
       settings = defaultSettings ++ MultiJvmPlugin.settings ++ Seq(
         extraOptions in MultiJvm <<= (sourceDirectory in MultiJvm) { src =>
            (name: String) => (src ** (name + ".conf")).get.headOption.map("-Dconfig.file=" + _.absolutePath).toSeq
         },
         test in Test <<= (test in Test) dependsOn (test in MultiJvm)
       )
     ) configs (MultiJvm)

     lazy val buildSettings = Defaults.defaultSettings ++ Seq(
       organization := "com.typesafe.akka",
       version      := "2.1-SNAPSHOT",
       scalaVersion := "2.9.1",
       crossPaths   := false
     )

     lazy val defaultSettings = buildSettings ++ Seq(
       resolvers += "Typesafe Repo" at "http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/"
     )

   }

You can specify JVM options for the forked JVMs::

    jvmOptions in MultiJvm := Seq("-Xmx256M")


Running tests
=============

The multi-jvm tasks are similar to the normal tasks: ``test``, ``test-only``,
and ``run``, but are under the ``multi-jvm`` configuration.

So in Akka, to run all the multi-JVM tests in the akka-remote project use (at
the sbt prompt):

.. code-block:: none

   akka-remote/multi-jvm:test

Or one can change to the ``akka-remote`` project first, and then run the
tests:

.. code-block:: none

   project akka-remote
   multi-jvm:test

To run individual tests use ``test-only``:

.. code-block:: none

   multi-jvm:test-only akka.remote.RandomRoutedRemoteActor

More than one test name can be listed to run multiple specific
tests. Tab-completion in sbt makes it easy to complete the test names.

It's also possible to specify JVM options with ``test-only`` by including those
options after the test names and ``--``. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    multi-jvm:test-only akka.remote.RandomRoutedRemoteActor -- -Dsome.option=something


Creating application tests
==========================

The tests are discovered, and combined, through a naming convention. MultiJvm tests are
located in ``src/multi-jvm/scala`` directory. A test is named with the following pattern:

.. code-block:: none

    {TestName}MultiJvm{NodeName}

That is, each test has ``MultiJvm`` in the middle of its name. The part before
it groups together tests/applications under a single ``TestName`` that will run
together. The part after, the ``NodeName``, is a distinguishing name for each
forked JVM.

So to create a 3-node test called ``Sample``, you can create three applications
like the following::

    package sample

    object SampleMultiJvmNode1 {
      def main(args: Array[String]) {
        println("Hello from node 1")
      }
    }

    object SampleMultiJvmNode2 {
      def main(args: Array[String]) {
        println("Hello from node 2")
      }
    }

    object SampleMultiJvmNode3 {
      def main(args: Array[String]) {
        println("Hello from node 3")
      }
    }

When you call ``multi-jvm:run sample.Sample`` at the sbt prompt, three JVMs will be
spawned, one for each node. It will look like this:

.. code-block:: none

    > multi-jvm:run sample.Sample
    ...
    [info] Starting JVM-Node1 for sample.SampleMultiJvmNode1
    [info] Starting JVM-Node2 for sample.SampleMultiJvmNode2
    [info] Starting JVM-Node3 for sample.SampleMultiJvmNode3
    [JVM-Node1] Hello from node 1
    [JVM-Node2] Hello from node 2
    [JVM-Node3] Hello from node 3
    [success] Total time: ...


Naming
======

You can change what the ``MultiJvm`` identifier is. For example, to change it to
``ClusterTest`` use the ``multiJvmMarker`` setting::

   multiJvmMarker in MultiJvm := "ClusterTest"

Your tests should now be named ``{TestName}ClusterTest{NodeName}``.


Configuration of the JVM instances
==================================

You can define specific JVM options for each of the spawned JVMs. You do that by creating
a file named after the node in the test with suffix ``.opts`` and put them in the same
directory as the test.

For example, to feed the JVM options ``-Dakka.remote.port=9991`` to the ``SampleMultiJvmNode1``
let's create three ``*.opts`` files and add the options to them.

``SampleMultiJvmNode1.opts``::

    -Dakka.remote.port=9991

``SampleMultiJvmNode2.opts``::

    -Dakka.remote.port=9992

``SampleMultiJvmNode3.opts``::

    -Dakka.remote.port=9993

ScalaTest
=========

There is also support for creating ScalaTest tests rather than applications. To
do this use the same naming convention as above, but create ScalaTest suites
rather than objects with main methods. You need to have ScalaTest on the
classpath. Here is a similar example to the one above but using ScalaTest::

    package sample

    import org.scalatest.WordSpec
    import org.scalatest.matchers.MustMatchers

    class SpecMultiJvmNode1 extends WordSpec with MustMatchers {
      "A node" should {
        "be able to say hello" in {
          val message = "Hello from node 1"
          message must be("Hello from node 1")
        }
      }
    }

    class SpecMultiJvmNode2 extends WordSpec with MustMatchers {
      "A node" should {
        "be able to say hello" in {
          val message = "Hello from node 2"
          message must be("Hello from node 2")
        }
      }
    }

To run just these tests you would call ``multi-jvm:test-only sample.Spec`` at
the sbt prompt.


Barriers
========

When running multi-JVM tests it's common to need to coordinate timing across
nodes. To do this, multi-JVM test framework has the notion of a double-barrier
(there is both an entry barrier and an exit barrier).
To wait at the entry use the ``enter`` method. To wait at the
exit use the ``leave`` method. It's also possible to pass a block of code which
will be run between the barriers.

There are 2 implementations of the barrier: one is used for coordinating JVMs
running on a single machine and is based on local files, another used in a distributed
scenario (see below) and is based on apache ZooKeeper. These two cases
are differentiated with ``test.hosts`` property defined. The choice for a proper barrier
implementation is made in `AkkaRemoteSpec`_ which is a base class for all multi-JVM tests
in Akka.

.. _AkkaRemoteSpec: https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/master/akka-remote/src/multi-jvm/scala/akka/remote/AkkaRemoteSpec.scala

When creating a barrier you pass it a name. You can also pass a timeout. The default
timeout is 60 seconds.

Here is an example of coordinating the starting of two nodes and then running
something in coordination::

    package sample

    import org.scalatest.WordSpec
    import org.scalatest.matchers.MustMatchers
    import org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll

    import akka.cluster._

    object SampleMultiJvmSpec extends AbstractRemoteActorMultiJvmSpec {
      val NrOfNodes = 2
      def commonConfig = ConfigFactory.parseString("""
        // Declare your configuration here.
      """)
    }

    class SampleMultiJvmNode1 extends AkkaRemoteSpec(SampleMultiJvmSpec.nodeConfigs(0))
      with WordSpec with MustMatchers {
      import SampleMultiJvmSpec._

      "A cluster" must {

        "have jvm options" in {
          System.getProperty("akka.remote.port", "") must be("9991")
          akka.config.Config.config.getString("test.name", "") must be("node1")
        }

        "be able to start all nodes" in {
          barrier("start")
          println("All nodes are started!")
          barrier("end")
        }
      }
    }

    class SampleMultiJvmNode2 extends AkkaRemoteSpec(SampleMultiJvmSpec.nodeConfigs(1))
      with WordSpec with MustMatchers {
      import SampleMultiJvmSpec._

      "A cluster" must {

        "have jvm options" in {
          System.getProperty("akka.remote.port", "") must be("9992")
          akka.config.Config.config.getString("test.name", "") must be("node2")
        }

        "be able to start all nodes" in {
          barrier("start")
          println("All nodes are started!")
          barrier("end")
        }
      }
    }

Running tests on many machines
==============================

The same tests that are run on a single machine using sbt-multi-jvm can be run on multiple
machines using schoir (read the same as ``esquire``) plugin. The plugin is included just like sbt-multi-jvm::

   resolvers += Classpaths.typesafeResolver

   addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.schoir" % "schoir" % "0.1.1")

The interaction with the plugin is through ``schoir:master`` input task. This input task optionally accepts the
path to the file with the following properties::

   git.url=git@github.com:akka/akka.git
   external.addresses.for.ssh=host1:port1,...,hostN:portN
   internal.host.names=host1,...,hostN

Alternative to specifying the property file, one can set respective settings in the build file::

   gitUrl := "git@github.com:akka/akka.git",
   machinesExt := List(InetAddress("host1", port1)),
   machinesInt := List("host1")

The reason the first property is called ``git.url`` is that the plugin sets up a temporary remote branch on git
to test against the local working copy. After the tests are finished the changes are regained and the branch
is deleted.

Each test machine starts a node in zookeeper server ensemble that can be used for synchronization. Since
the server is started on a fixed port, it's not currently possible to run more than one test session on the
same machine at the same time.

The machines that are used for testing (slaves) should have ssh access to the outside world and be able to talk
to each other with the internal addresses given. On the master machine ssh client is required. Obviosly git
and sbt should be installed on both master and slave machines.

The Test Conductor Extension
============================

The Test Conductor Extension is aimed at enhancing the multi JVM and multi node testing facilities.

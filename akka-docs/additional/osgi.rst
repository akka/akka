Akka in OSGi
============

Configuring the OSGi Framework
------------------------------

To use Akka in an OSGi environment, the ``org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation``
property must be set to always delegate the ``sun.misc`` package to the boot classloader
instead of resolving it through the normal OSGi class space.

# Camel

The akka-camel module was deprecated in 2.5 and has been removed in 2.6.

As an alternative we recommend [Alpakka](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/). This is of course not a drop-in replacement.

If anyone is interested in setting up akka-camel as a separate community-maintained repository then please get in touch.

# Java 8 Compatibility

Akka requires that you have [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or
later installed on your machine.

Starting with Akka 2.4.2 we have begun to introduce Java 8 types (most
prominently `java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage` and
`java.util.Optional`) where that was possible without breaking binary or
source compatibility. Where this was not possible (for example in the return
type of `ActorSystem.terminate()`) please refer to the
`scala-java8-compat` library that allows easy conversion between the Scala
and Java counterparts. The artifact can be included in Maven builds using:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.scala-lang.modules</groupId>
  <artifactId>scala-java8-compat_2.12</artifactId>
  <version>0.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

We will only be able to seamlessly integrate all functional interfaces once
we can rely on Scala 2.12 to provide full interoperabilityâ€”this will mean that
Scala users can directly implement Java Functional Interfaces using lambda syntax
as well as that Java users can directly implement Scala functions using lambda
syntax.

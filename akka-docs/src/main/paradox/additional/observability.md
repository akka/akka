# Monitoring

Aside from log monitoring and the monitoring provided by your APM or platform provider, [Lightbend Telemetry](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/telemetry/current/instrumentations/akka/akka.html), available through a [Lightbend Platform Subscription](https://www.lightbend.com/lightbend-platform-subscription), can provide additional insights in the run-time characteristics of your application, including metrics, events, and distributed tracing for Akka Actors, Cluster, HTTP, and more.

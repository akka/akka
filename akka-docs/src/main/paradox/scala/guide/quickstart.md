# Quickstart

After all this introduction, we are ready to build our first actor system. We will do so in five chapters.
This first chapter will help you to set up your project, tools and have a simple "Hello World" demo running.
We will keep this section to a bare minimum and then extend the sample application in the next chapter.

> Our goal in this chapter is to set up a working environment for you, create an application that starts up and stops
an ActorSystem and create an actor which we will run and test.

Akka requires that you have [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or
later installed on your machine.

As the very first thing, we need to make sure that we can compile our project and have a working IDE setup to be
able to edit code comfortably.

**FIXME all links to hello-akka shall be replaced by akka-scala-seed / akka-java-seed**

The easiest way is to use the @scala[`akka-scala-seed` in [Get started with Lightbend technologies](http://dev.lightbend.com/start/?group=akka&project=hello-akka)] @java[`akka-java-seed` in [Get started with Lightbend technologies](http://dev.lightbend.com/start/?group=akka&project=hello-akka)] 

1. Enter Project Name and create the project from the @scala[[akka-scala-seed](http://dev.lightbend.com/start/?group=akka&project=hello-akka)] @scala[[akka-java-seed](http://dev.lightbend.com/start/?group=akka&project=hello-akka)] page.

1. Unzip the zip file and rename the directory to your preference.

1. Read the @scala[[Guide](http://developer.lightbend.com/guides/hello-akka/)] @java[[Guide](http://developer.lightbend.com/guides/hello-akka/)] for this example project. It describes the example, the basic concepts of actors and how to run the "Hello World" application. **FIXME the Guide is in progress [here](https://github.com/akka/akka-scala-seed.g8/pull/4/files#diff-179702d743b88d85b3971cba561e6ace)**.

After that you can go back here and you are ready to dive deeper.

## Intro

Akka Cluster provides a fault-tolerant decentralized peer-to-peer based cluster
[membership](#membership) service with no single point of failure or single point of bottleneck.
It does this using [gossip](#gossip) protocols and an automatic [failure detector](#failure-detector).

## Terms

**node**
: A logical member of a cluster. There could be multiple nodes on a physical
machine. Defined by a *hostname:port:uid* tuple.

**cluster**
: A set of nodes joined together through the [membership](#membership) service.

**leader**
: A single node in the cluster that acts as the leader. Managing cluster convergence
and membership state transitions.


## Membership

A cluster is made up of a set of member nodes. The identifier for each node is a
`hostname:port:uid` tuple. An Akka application can be distributed over a cluster with
each node hosting some part of the application. Cluster membership and the actors running
on that node of the application are decoupled. A node could be a member of a
cluster without hosting any actors. Joining a cluster is initiated
by issuing a `Join` command to one of the nodes in the cluster to join.

The node identifier internally also contains a UID that uniquely identifies this
actor system instance at that `hostname:port`. Akka uses the UID to be able to
reliably trigger remote death watch. This means that the same actor system can never
join a cluster again once it's been removed from that cluster. To re-join an actor
system with the same `hostname:port` to a cluster you have to stop the actor system
and start a new one with the same `hostname:port` which will then receive a different
UID.

The cluster membership state is a specialized [CRDT](http://hal.upmc.fr/docs/00/55/55/88/PDF/techreport.pdf), which means that it has a monotonic
merge function. When concurrent changes occur on different nodes the updates can always be
merged and converge to the same end result.

### Gossip

The cluster membership used in Akka is based on Amazon's [Dynamo](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf) system and
particularly the approach taken in Basho's' [Riak](http://basho.com/technology/architecture/) distributed database.
Cluster membership is communicated using a [Gossip Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol), where the current
state of the cluster is gossiped randomly through the cluster, with preference to
members that have not seen the latest version.

#### Vector Clocks

[Vector clocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock) are a type of data structure and algorithm for generating a partial
ordering of events in a distributed system and detecting causality violations.

We use vector clocks to reconcile and merge differences in cluster state
during gossiping. A vector clock is a set of (node, counter) pairs. Each update
to the cluster state has an accompanying update to the vector clock.

#### Gossip Convergence

Information about the cluster converges locally at a node at certain points in time.
This is when a node can prove that the cluster state he is observing has been observed
by all other nodes in the cluster. Convergence is implemented by passing a set of nodes
that have seen current state version during gossip. This information is referred to as the
seen set in the gossip overview. When all nodes are included in the seen set there is
convergence.

Gossip convergence cannot occur while any nodes are `unreachable`. The nodes need
to become `reachable` again, or moved to the `down` and `removed` states
(see the [Membership Lifecycle](#membership-lifecycle) section below). This only blocks the leader
from performing its cluster membership management and does not influence the application
running on top of the cluster. For example this means that during a network partition
it is not possible to add more nodes to the cluster. The nodes can join, but they
will not be moved to the `up` state until the partition has healed or the unreachable
nodes have been downed.

#### Failure Detector

The failure detector is responsible for trying to detect if a node is
`unreachable` from the rest of the cluster. For this we are using an
implementation of [The Phi Accrual Failure Detector](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~defago/files/pdf/IS_RR_2004_010.pdf) by Hayashibara et al.

An accrual failure detector decouples monitoring and interpretation. That makes
them applicable to a wider area of scenarios and more adequate to build generic
failure detection services. The idea is that it is keeping a history of failure
statistics, calculated from heartbeats received from other nodes, and is
trying to do educated guesses by taking multiple factors, and how they
accumulate over time, into account in order to come up with a better guess if a
specific node is up or down. Rather than just answering "yes" or "no" to the
question "is the node down?" it returns a `phi` value representing the
likelihood that the node is down.

The `threshold` that is the basis for the calculation is configurable by the
user. A low `threshold` is prone to generate many wrong suspicions but ensures
a quick detection in the event of a real crash. Conversely, a high `threshold`
generates fewer mistakes but needs more time to detect actual crashes. The
default `threshold` is 8 and is appropriate for most situations. However in
cloud environments, such as Amazon EC2, the value could be increased to 12 in
order to account for network issues that sometimes occur on such platforms.

In a cluster each node is monitored by a few (default maximum 5) other nodes, and when
any of these detects the node as `unreachable` that information will spread to
the rest of the cluster through the gossip. In other words, only one node needs to
mark a node `unreachable` to have the rest of the cluster mark that node `unreachable`.

The nodes to monitor are picked out of neighbors in a hashed ordered node ring.
This is to increase the likelihood to monitor across racks and data centers, but the order
is the same on all nodes, which ensures full coverage.

Heartbeats are sent out every second and every heartbeat is performed in a request/reply
handshake with the replies used as input to the failure detector.

The failure detector will also detect if the node becomes `reachable` again. When
all nodes that monitored the `unreachable` node detects it as `reachable` again
the cluster, after gossip dissemination, will consider it as `reachable`.

If system messages cannot be delivered to a node it will be quarantined and then it
cannot come back from `unreachable`. This can happen if the there are too many
unacknowledged system messages (e.g. watch, Terminated, remote actor deployment,
failures of actors supervised by remote parent). Then the node needs to be moved
to the `down` or `removed` states (see the [Membership Lifecycle](#membership-lifecycle) section below)
and the actor system must be restarted before it can join the cluster again.

#### Leader

After gossip convergence a `leader` for the cluster can be determined. There is no
`leader` election process, the `leader` can always be recognised deterministically
by any node whenever there is gossip convergence. The leader is just a role, any node
can be the leader and it can change between convergence rounds.
The `leader` is simply the first node in sorted order that is able to take the leadership role,
where the preferred member states for a `leader` are `up` and `leaving`
(see the [Membership Lifecycle](#membership-lifecycle) section below for more  information about member states).

The role of the `leader` is to shift members in and out of the cluster, changing
`joining` members to the `up` state or `exiting` members to the `removed`
state. Currently `leader` actions are only triggered by receiving a new cluster
state with gossip convergence.

The `leader` also has the power, if configured so, to "auto-down" a node that
according to the [Failure Detector](#failure-detector) is considered `unreachable`. This means setting
the `unreachable` node status to `down` automatically after a configured time
of unreachability.

#### Seed Nodes

The seed nodes are configured contact points for new nodes joining the cluster.
When a new node is started it sends a message to all seed nodes and then sends
a join command to the seed node that answers first.

The seed nodes configuration value does not have any influence on the running
cluster itself, it is only relevant for new nodes joining the cluster as it
helps them to find contact points to send the join command to; a new member
can send this command to any current member of the cluster, not only to the seed nodes.

#### Gossip Protocol

A variation of *push-pull gossip* is used to reduce the amount of gossip
information sent around the cluster. In push-pull gossip a digest is sent
representing current versions but not actual values; the recipient of the gossip
can then send back any values for which it has newer versions and also request
values for which it has outdated versions. Akka uses a single shared state with
a vector clock for versioning, so the variant of push-pull gossip used in Akka
makes use of this version to only push the actual state as needed.

Periodically, the default is every 1 second, each node chooses another random
node to initiate a round of gossip with. If less than Â½ of the nodes resides in the
seen set (have seen the new state) then the cluster gossips 3 times instead of once
every second. This adjusted gossip interval is a way to speed up the convergence process
in the early dissemination phase after a state change.

The choice of node to gossip with is random but biased towards nodes that might not have seen
the current state version. During each round of gossip exchange, when convergence is not yet reached, a node
uses a very high probability (which is configurable) to gossip with another node which is not part of the seen set, i.e. 
which is likely to have an older version of the state. Otherwise it gossips with any random live node.

This biased selection is a way to speed up the convergence process in the late dissemination
phase after a state change.

For clusters larger than 400 nodes (configurable, and suggested by empirical evidence)
the 0.8 probability is gradually reduced to avoid overwhelming single stragglers with
too many concurrent gossip requests. The gossip receiver also has a mechanism to
protect itself from too many simultaneous gossip messages by dropping messages that
have been enqueued in the mailbox for too long of a time.

While the cluster is in a converged state the gossiper only sends a small gossip status message containing the gossip
version to the chosen node. As soon as there is a change to the cluster (meaning non-convergence)
then it goes back to biased gossip again.

The recipient of the gossip state or the gossip status can use the gossip version
(vector clock) to determine whether:

 1. it has a newer version of the gossip state, in which case it sends that back
to the gossiper
 2. it has an outdated version of the state, in which case the recipient requests
the current state from the gossiper by sending back its version of the gossip state
 3. it has conflicting gossip versions, in which case the different versions are merged
and sent back

If the recipient and the gossip have the same version then the gossip state is
not sent or requested.

The periodic nature of the gossip has a nice batching effect of state changes,
e.g. joining several nodes quickly after each other to one node will result in only
one state change to be spread to other members in the cluster.

The gossip messages are serialized with [protobuf](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) and also gzipped to reduce payload
size.

### Membership Lifecycle

A node begins in the `joining` state. Once all nodes have seen that the new
node is joining (through gossip convergence) the `leader` will set the member
state to `up`.

If a node is leaving the cluster in a safe, expected manner then it switches to
the `leaving` state. Once the leader sees the convergence on the node in the
`leaving` state, the leader will then move it to `exiting`.  Once all nodes
have seen the exiting state (convergence) the `leader` will remove the node
from the cluster, marking it as `removed`.

If a node is `unreachable` then gossip convergence is not possible and therefore
any `leader` actions are also not possible (for instance, allowing a node to
become a part of the cluster). To be able to move forward the state of the
`unreachable` nodes must be changed. It must become `reachable` again or marked
as `down`. If the node is to join the cluster again the actor system must be
restarted and go through the joining process again. The cluster can, through the
leader, also *auto-down* a node after a configured time of unreachability. If new
incarnation of unreachable node tries to rejoin the cluster old incarnation will be 
marked as `down` and new incarnation can rejoin the cluster without manual intervention. 

@@@ note

If you have *auto-down* enabled and the failure detector triggers, you
can over time end up with a lot of single node clusters if you don't put
measures in place to shut down nodes that have become `unreachable`. This
follows from the fact that the `unreachable` node will likely see the rest of
the cluster as `unreachable`, become its own leader and form its own cluster.

@@@

As mentioned before, if a node is `unreachable` then gossip convergence is not
possible and therefore any `leader` actions are also not possible. By enabling
`akka.cluster.allow-weakly-up-members` (enabled by default) it is possible to 
let new joining nodes be promoted while convergence is not yet reached. These 
`Joining` nodes will be promoted as `WeaklyUp`. Once gossip convergence is 
reached, the leader will move `WeaklyUp` members to `Up`.

Note that members on the other side of a network partition have no knowledge about 
the existence of the new members. You should for example not count `WeaklyUp` 
members in quorum decisions.

#### State Diagram for the Member States (`akka.cluster.allow-weakly-up-members=on`)

![member-states-weakly-up.png](../../images/member-states-weakly-up.png)

#### Member States

 * **joining** - transient state when joining a cluster
   
 * **weakly up** - transient state while network split (only if `akka.cluster.allow-weakly-up-members=on`)
   
 * **up** - normal operating state
   
 * **leaving** / **exiting** - states during graceful removal
   
 * **down** - marked as down (no longer part of cluster decisions)
   
 * **removed** - tombstone state (no longer a member)
   

#### User Actions

 * **join** - join a single node to a cluster - can be explicit or automatic on
startup if a node to join have been specified in the configuration
   
 * **leave** - tell a node to leave the cluster gracefully
   
 * **down** - mark a node as down
   

#### Leader Actions

The `leader` has the following duties:

 * shifting members in and out of the cluster
    * joining -> up
    * exiting -> removed

#### Failure Detection and Unreachability

 * **fd*** - the failure detector of one of the monitoring nodes has triggered
causing the monitored node to be marked as unreachable
   
 * **unreachable*** - unreachable is not a real member states but more of a flag in addition to the state signaling that the cluster is unable to talk to this node, after being unreachable the failure detector may detect it as reachable again and thereby remove the flag

# Cluster Singleton

To use the cluster singletons add the following dependency:

@@dependency [sbt,Maven,Gradle] {
  group=com.typesafe.akka
  artifact=akka-cluster-typed_2.12
  version=$akka.version$
}

For some use cases it is convenient and sometimes also mandatory to ensure that
you have exactly one actor of a certain type running somewhere in the cluster.

Some examples:

 * single point of responsibility for certain cluster-wide consistent decisions, or
coordination of actions across the cluster system
 * single entry point to an external system
 * single master, many workers
 * centralized naming service, or routing logic

Using a singleton should not be the first design choice. It has several drawbacks,
such as single-point of bottleneck. Single-point of failure is also a relevant concern,
but for some cases this feature takes care of that by making sure that another singleton
instance will eventually be started.

# Example

Any `Behavior` can be run as a singleton. E.g. a basic counter:

Scala
:  @@snip [ShardingCompileOnlySpec.scala]($akka$/akka-cluster-sharding-typed/src/test/scala/doc/akka/cluster/sharding/typed/ShardingCompileOnlySpec.scala) { #sharding-extension }

Java
:  @@snip [ShardingCompileOnlyTest.java]($akka$/akka-cluster-sharding-typed/src/test/java/jdoc/akka/cluster/sharding/typed/ShardingCompileOnlyTest.java) { #sharding-extension }

Then on every node in the cluster, or every node with a given role, use the `ClusterSingleton` extension
to spawn the singleton. Only a single instance will run in the cluster:


Scala
:  @@snip [ShardingCompileOnlySpec.scala]($akka$/akka-cluster-sharding-typed/src/test/scala/doc/akka/cluster/sharding/typed/ShardingCompileOnlySpec.scala) { #singleton }

Java
:  @@snip [ShardingCompileOnlyTest.java]($akka$/akka-cluster-sharding-typed/src/test/java/jdoc/akka/cluster/sharding/typed/ShardingCompileOnlyTest.java) { #singleton }

# Getting Started Guide

@@@ note

This module is ready to be used in production, but it is still marked as @ref:[may change](../../common/may-change.md).
This means that API or semantics can change without warning or deprecation period, but such changes will
be collected and be performed in Akka 2.6.0 rather than in 2.5.x patch releases.

## Command handlers in the state

We can take the previous bank account example one step further by handling the commands within the state as well.

Take note of how the command handler is delegating to `applyCommand` in the `Account` (state), which is implemented
in the concrete `EmptyAccount`, `OpenedAccount`, and `ClosedAccount`.

## Optional initial state

Sometimes it's not desirable to use a separate state class for the empty initial state, but rather act as if 
there is no state yet.
@java[You can use `null` as the `emptyState`, but be aware of that the `state` parameter
will be `null` until the first non-null state has been persisted 
It's possible to use `Optional` instead of `null`, but that requires extra boilerplate
to unwrap the `Optional` state parameter. Therefore use of `null` is simpler. The following example
illustrates using `null` as the `emptyState`.]
@scala[`Option[State]` can be used as the state type and `None` as the `emptyState`. Then pattern matching
is used in command handlers at the outer layer before delegating to the state or other methods.]

## Leveraging Java 21 features

When building durable state entities in a project using Java 21 or newer, the @javadoc[DurableStateOnCommandBehavior](akka.persistence.typed.statejavadsl.DurableStateOnCommandBehavior)
base class provides an API that let you leverage the switch pattern match feature. When combined with `sealed` command
and event top types this gives you a more direct handling of commands and events as well as a compile time completeness
check that you have handled all kinds of commands and events in your event sourced behavior handler methods:

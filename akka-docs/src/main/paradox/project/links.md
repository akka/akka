## Releases Repository

The Akka dependencies are available from Akka's library repository. To access them there, you need to configure the URL for this repository.

@@repository [sbt,Maven,Gradle] {
id="akka-repository"
name="Akka library repository"
url="https://repo.akka.io/maven"
}

## Snapshots Repository

Snapshot builds are available from the repository at `https://repo.akka.io/snapshots`. All Akka modules that belong to the same build have the same version.

@@@ warning

The use of Akka SNAPSHOTs, nightlies and milestone releases is discouraged unless you know what you are doing.

### sbt definition of snapshot repository

Make sure that you add the repository to the sbt resolvers:

```
resolvers += "Akka library snapshot repository".at("https://repo.akka.io/snapshots")
```

Define the library dependencies with the complete version. For example:

@@@vars
```
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" % "akka-cluster_$scala.binary.version$" % "2.9.0+72-53943d99-SNAPSHOT"
```

      <name>Akka library snapshot repository</name>
      <url>https://repo.akka.io/snapshots</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
</repositories>
```

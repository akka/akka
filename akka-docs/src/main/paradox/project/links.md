### sbt definition of snapshot repository

Make sure that you add the repository to the sbt resolvers:

```
resolvers += "Akka library snapshot repository".at("https://repo.akka.io/TOKEN/secure/snapshots")
```

Define the library dependencies with the complete version. For example:

@@@vars
```
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.akka" % "akka-cluster_$scala.binary.version$" % "2.9.0+72-53943d99-SNAPSHOT"
```

### Maven definition of snapshot repository

Make sure that you add the repository to the Maven repositories in pom.xml:

```
<repositories>
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>akka-repository</id>
      <name>Akka library snapshot repository</name>
      <url>https://repo.akka.io/TOKEN/secure/snapshots</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
</repositories>
```

Define the library dependencies with the complete version. For example:

@@@vars

# Fault Tolerance

As explained in @ref:[Actor Systems](general/actor-systems.md) each actor is the supervisor of its
children, and as such each actor defines fault handling supervisor strategy.
This strategy cannot be changed afterwards as it is an integral part of the
actor systemâ€™s structure.

## Creating a Supervisor Strategy

TODO

### Default Supervisor Strategy

### Restart Supervisor Strategy

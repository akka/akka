# ActorFlow.ask

Use the "Ask Pattern" to send each stream element as an `ask` to the target actor (of the new actors API), and expect a reply back that will be emitted downstream.

@ref[Actor interop operators](../index.md#actor-interop-operators)

## Dependency

This operator is included in:

@@dependency[sbt,Maven,Gradle] {
  group="com.typesafe.akka"
  artifact="akka-stream-typed_$scala.binary.version$"
  version="$akka.version$"
}

## Signature

@apidoc[ActorFlow.ask](ActorFlow$) { scala="#ask%5BI,Q,A](ref:akka.actor.typed.ActorRef%5BQ])(makeMessage:(I,akka.actor.typed.ActorRef%5BA])=%3EQ)(implicittimeout:akka.util.Timeout):akka.stream.scaladsl.Flow%5BI,A,akka.NotUsed]" java="#ask(akka.actor.typed.ActorRef,java.time.Duration,java.util.function.BiFunction)" }

## Description

Use the @ref[Ask pattern](../../../typed/interaction-patterns.md#request-response-with-ask-from-outside-an-actor) to send a request-reply message to the target `ref` actor.
If any of the asks times out it will fail the stream with an @apidoc[AskTimeoutException].

The `ask` operator requires

* the actor `ref`,
* a `makeMessage` function to create the message sent to the actor from the incoming element and the actor ref accepting the actor's reply message,
* and a timeout.

See also:

* @ref[Flow.ask](../Source-or-Flow/ask.md) for the classic actors variant

## Examples

The `ActorFlow.ask` sends a message to the actor which expects `Asking` messages which contain the actor ref for replies of type `Reply`. The replies are emitted when received and the `map` extracts the message `String`.

## Reactive Streams semantics

@@@div { .callout }

**emits** when the futures (in submission order) created by the ask pattern internally are completed

**backpressures** when the number of futures reaches the configured parallelism and the downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes and all futures have been completed and all elements have been emitted

**fails** when the passed in actor terminates, or a timeout is exceeded in any of the asks performed

**cancels** when downstream cancels

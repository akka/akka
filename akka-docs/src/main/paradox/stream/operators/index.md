## Additional Sink and Source converters

Sources and sinks for integrating with `java.io.InputStream` and `java.io.OutputStream` can be found on
`StreamConverters`. As they are blocking APIs the implementations of these operators are run on a separate
dispatcher configured through the `akka.stream.blocking-io-dispatcher`.

@@@ warning

Be aware that `asInputStream` and `asOutputStream` materialize `InputStream` and `OutputStream` respectively as
blocking API implementation. They will block the thread until data will be available from upstream.
Because of blocking nature these objects cannot be used in `mapMaterializeValue` section as it causes deadlock
of the stream materialization process.
For example, following snippet will fall with timeout exception:

```scala
...
.toMat(StreamConverters.asInputStream().mapMaterializedValue { inputStream =>
        inputStream.read()  // this could block forever
        ...
}).run()
```

@@@

## File IO Sinks and Sources

Sources and sinks for reading and writing files can be found on `FileIO`.

| |Operator|Description|
|--|--|--|
|FileIO|<a name="fromfile"></a>@ref[fromFile](FileIO/fromFile.md)|Emits the contents of a file.|
|FileIO|<a name="frompath"></a>@ref[fromPath](FileIO/fromPath.md)|Emits the contents of a file from the given path.|

|FileIO|<a name="topath"></a>@ref[toPath](FileIO/toPath.md)|Create a sink which will write incoming `ByteString` s to a given file path.|

## Simple operators

These operators can transform the rate of incoming elements since there are operators that emit multiple elements for a
single input (e.g. `mapConcat`) or consume multiple elements before emitting one output (e.g. `filter`).
However, these rate transformations are data-driven, i.e. it is the incoming elements that define how the
rate is affected. This is in contrast with [detached operators](#backpressure-aware-operators) which can change their processing behavior
depending on being backpressured by downstream or not.

operation at the same time (usually handling the completion of a @scala[`Future`] @java[`CompletionStage`]).

|Source/Flow|<a name="extrapolate"></a>@ref[extrapolate](Source-or-Flow/extrapolate.md)|Allow for a faster downstream by expanding the last emitted element to an `Iterator`.|

## Nesting and flattening operators

These operators either take a stream and turn it into a stream of streams (nesting) or they take a stream that contains
nested streams and turn them into a stream of elements instead (flattening).

## Fan-out operators

These have one input and multiple outputs. They might route the elements between different outputs, or emit elements on
multiple outputs at the same time.

There is a number of fan-out operators for which currently no 'fluent' is API available. To use those you will have to use the @ref[Graph DSL](../stream-graphs.md#constructing-graphs).

|Source/Flow|<a name="wiretap"></a>@ref[wireTap](Source-or-Flow/wireTap.md)|Attaches the given `Sink` to this `Flow` as a wire tap, meaning that elements that pass through will also be sent to the wire-tap `Sink`, without the latter affecting the mainline flow.|

## Additional Sink and Source converters

Sources and sinks for integrating with `java.io.InputStream` and `java.io.OutputStream` can be found on
`StreamConverters`. As they are blocking APIs the implementations of these operators are run on a separate
dispatcher configured through the `akka.stream.blocking-io-dispatcher`.

@@@ warning

Be aware that `asInputStream` and `asOutputStream` materialize `InputStream` and `OutputStream` respectively as
blocking API implementation. They will block the thread until data will be available from upstream.
Because of blocking nature these objects cannot be used in `mapMaterializeValue` section as it causes deadlock
of the stream materialization process.
For example, following snippet will fall with timeout exception:

```scala
...
.toMat(StreamConverters.asInputStream().mapMaterializedValue { inputStream ⇒
        inputStream.read()  // this could block forever
        ...
}).run()
```

|FileIO|<a name="topath"></a>@ref[toPath](FileIO/toPath.md)|Create a sink which will write incoming `ByteString` s to a given file path.|

## Simple operators

These operators can transform the rate of incoming elements since there are operators that emit multiple elements for a
single input (e.g. `mapConcat`) or consume multiple elements before emitting one output (e.g. `filter`).
However, these rate transformations are data-driven, i.e. it is the incoming elements that define how the
rate is affected. This is in contrast with [detached operators](#backpressure-aware-operators) which can change their processing behavior
depending on being backpressured by downstream or not.

|Source/Flow|<a name="extrapolate"></a>@ref[extrapolate](Source-or-Flow/extrapolate.md)|Allow for a faster downstream by expanding the last emitted element to an `Iterator`.|

## Nesting and flattening operators

These operators either take a stream and turn it into a stream of streams (nesting) or they take a stream that contains
nested streams and turn them into a stream of elements instead (flattening).

See the @ref:[Substreams](../stream-substream.md) page for more detail and code samples.

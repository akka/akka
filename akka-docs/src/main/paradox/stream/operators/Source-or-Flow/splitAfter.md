## Description

End the current substream whenever a predicate returns `true`, starting a new substream for the next element.

## Example

Given some time series data source we would like to split the stream into sub-streams for each second.
By using `sliding` we can compare the timestamp of the current and next element to decide when to split.

Scala
:  @@snip [Scan.scala](/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/stream/operators/sourceorflow/Split.scala) { #splitAfter }

Java
:  @@snip [SourceOrFlow.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/operators/sourceorflow/Split.java) { #splitAfter }

An alternative way of implementing this is shown in @ref:[splitWhen example](splitWhen.md#example).

## Reactive Streams semantics

@@@div { .callout }

**emits** when an element passes through. When the provided predicate is true it emits the element * and opens a new substream for subsequent element

**backpressures** when there is an element pending for the next substream, but the previous is not fully consumed yet, or the substream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes (Until the end of stream it is not possible to know whether new substreams will be needed or not)

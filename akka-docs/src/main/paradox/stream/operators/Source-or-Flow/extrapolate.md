## Description

Allow for a faster downstream by expanding the last emitted element to an `Iterator`. For example, an
`Iterator.continually(element)` will cause `extrapolate` to keep repeating the last emitted element. 

All original elements are always emitted unchanged - the `Iterator` is only used whenever there is downstream
 demand before upstream emits a new element.

Includes an optional `initial` argument to prevent blocking the entire stream when there are multiple producers.

See @ref:[Understanding extrapolate and expand](../../stream-rate.md#understanding-extrapolate-and-expand) for more information
and examples.

## Example

Imagine a videoconference client decoding a video feed from a colleague working remotely. It is possible 
the network bandwidth is a bit unreliable. It's fine, as long as the audio remains fluent, it doesn't matter
if we can't decode a frame or two (or more). When a frame is dropped, though, we want the UI to shwo the last 
frame decoded:

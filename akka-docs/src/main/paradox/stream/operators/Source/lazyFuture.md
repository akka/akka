# lazyFuture

Defers creation of a future of a single element source until there is demand.

## Signature

@@signature [Source.scala](/akka-stream/src/main/scala/akka/stream/scaladsl/Source.scala) { #lazyFuture }

@@@

## Description

Invokes the user supplied factory when the first downstream demand arrives. When the returned future completes 
successfully the value is emitted downstream as a single stream element. If the future or the factory fails the 
stream is failed.

Note that asynchronous boundaries (and other operators) in the stream may do pre-fetching which counter acts
the laziness and will trigger the factory immediately.

## Reactive Streams semantics

@@@div { .callout }

**emits** when there is downstream demand and the element factory returned future has completed

**completes** after emitting the single element

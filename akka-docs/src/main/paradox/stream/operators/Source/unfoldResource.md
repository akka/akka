# Source.unfoldResource

Wrap any resource that can be opened, queried for next element (in a blocking way) and closed using three distinct functions into a source.

## Description

`Source.unfoldResource` allows us to safely extract stream elements from blocking resources by providing it with three functions: 

1. `create`: Open or create the resource
1. `read`: Fetch the next element or signal that we reached the end of the stream by returning a @java[`Optional.empty`]@scala[`None`]
1. `close`: Close the resource, invoked on end of stream or if the stream fails

The functions are by default called on Akka's dispatcher for blocking IO to avoid interfering with other stream operations. 
See @ref:[Blocking Needs Careful Management](../../../typed/dispatchers.md#blocking-needs-careful-management) for an explanation on why this is important.

Note that there are pre-built `unfoldResource`-like operators to wrap `java.io.InputStream`s in 
@ref:[Additional Sink and Source converters](../index.md#additional-sink-and-source-converters), 
`Iterator` in @ref:[fromIterator](fromIterator.md) and File IO in @ref:[File IO Sinks and Sources](../index.md#file-io-sinks-and-sources).
Additional prebuilt technology specific connectors can also be found in the [Alpakka project](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/).

## Examples

Imagine we have a database API which may potentially block both when we initially perform a query and 
on retrieving each result from the query. It also gives us an iterator like way to determine if we have reached
the end of the result and a close method that must be called to free resources:

Scala

Java
:   @@snip [UnfoldResource.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/operators/source/UnfoldResource.java) { #unfoldResource-blocking-api }

Let's see how we use the API above safely through `unfoldResource`:

Scala
:   @@snip [UnfoldResource.scala](/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/stream/operators/source/UnfoldResource.scala) { #unfoldResource }

Java
:   @@snip [UnfoldResource.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/operators/source/UnfoldResource.java) { #unfoldResource }

If the resource produces more than one element at a time, combining `unfoldResource` with 
@scala[`mapConcat(identity)`]@java[`mapConcat(elems -> elems)`] will give you a stream of individual elements.
See @ref:[mapConcat](../Source-or-Flow/mapConcat.md)) for details.

## Reactive Streams semantics

@@@div { .callout }

**emits** when there is demand and the `read` function returns a value

**completes** when the `read` function returns @scala[`None`]@java[an empty `Optional`]

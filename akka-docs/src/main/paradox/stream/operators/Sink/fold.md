## Description

Fold over emitted element with a function, where each invocation will get the new element and the result from the
previous fold invocation. The first invocation will be provided the `zero` value.

Materializes into a @scala[`Future`] @java[`CompletionStage`] that will complete with the last state when the stream has completed.

This operator allows combining values into a result without a global mutable state by instead passing the state along
between invocations.

## Reactive Streams semantics

@@@div { .callout }

**cancels** never

**backpressures** when the previous fold function invocation has not yet completed

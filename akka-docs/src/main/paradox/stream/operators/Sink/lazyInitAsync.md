## Description

`lazyInitAsync` has been deprecated in 2.6.0, use @ref:[lazyFutureSink](lazyFutureSink.md) instead.

Creates a real `Sink` upon receiving the first element. Internal `Sink` will not be created if there are no elements,
because of completion or error.

- If upstream completes before an element was received then the @scala[`Future`]@java[`CompletionStage`] is completed with @scala[`None`]@java[an empty `Optional`].
- If upstream fails before an element was received, `sinkFactory` throws an exception, or materialization of the internal
  sink fails then the @scala[`Future`]@java[`CompletionStage`] is completed with the exception.
- Otherwise the @scala[`Future`]@java[`CompletionStage`] is completed with the materialized value of the internal sink.

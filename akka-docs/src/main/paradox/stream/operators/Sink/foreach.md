# foreach

Invoke a given procedure for each element received.

@ref[Sink operators](../index.md#sink-operators)

## Signature

@apidoc[Sink.foreach](Sink$) { java="#foreach(akka.japi.function.Procedure)" scala="#foreach[T](f:T=%3EUnit):akka.stream.scaladsl.Sink[T,scala.concurrent.Future[akka.Done]]" }

## Description

Invoke a given procedure for each element received. Note that it is not safe to mutate shared state from the procedure.

The sink materializes into a @scala[`Future[Done]`] @java[`CompletionStage<Done>`] which completes when the
stream completes, or fails if the stream fails.

Note that it is not safe to mutate state from the procedure.

See also:

* @ref[`foreachAsync`](foreachAsync.md) Invoke a given procedure asynchronously for each element received.
* @ref[`actorRef`](actorRef.md) Send the elements from the stream to an `ActorRef`.

## Example

This prints out every element to standard out.

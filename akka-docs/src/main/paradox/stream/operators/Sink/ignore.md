## Description

Consume all elements but discards them. Useful when a stream has to be consumed but there is no use to actually
do anything with the elements in the `Sink`. Processing of the elements may occur in the `Source`/`Flow`. 

## Example

This examples reads lines from a file, saves them to a database, and stores the database identifiers in
another file. The stream is run with `Sink.ignore` because all processing of the elements have been performed
by the preceding stream operators.

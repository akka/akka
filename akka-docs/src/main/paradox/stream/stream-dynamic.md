## Controlling stream completion with KillSwitch

A @apidoc[akka.stream.KillSwitch] allows the completion of operators of @apidoc[akka.stream.FlowShape] from the outside. It consists of a flow element that
can be linked to an operator of `FlowShape` needing completion control.
The `KillSwitch` @scala[trait] @java[interface] allows to:
 
 * complete the stream(s) via @apidoc[shutdown()](akka.stream.KillSwitch) {scala="#shutdown():Unit" java="#shutdown()"}
 * fail the stream(s) via @apidoc[abort(Throwable error)](akka.stream.KillSwitch) {scala="#abort(ex:Throwable):Unit" java="#abort(java.lang.Throwable)"}


Scala
:   @@snip [KillSwitch.scala](/akka-stream/src/main/scala/akka/stream/KillSwitch.scala) { #kill-switch }

After the first call to either `shutdown` or `abort`, all subsequent calls to any of these methods will be ignored.
Stream completion is performed by both

 * cancelling its upstream.
 * completing (in case of `shutdown`) or failing (in case of `abort`) its downstream

A `KillSwitch` can control the completion of one or multiple streams, and therefore comes in two different flavours.

### UniqueKillSwitch

@apidoc[akka.stream.UniqueKillSwitch] allows to control the completion of **one** materialized @apidoc[akka.stream.Graph] of @apidoc[akka.stream.FlowShape]. Refer to the

### SharedKillSwitch

A @apidoc[akka.stream.SharedKillSwitch] allows to control the completion of an arbitrary number operators of @apidoc[akka.stream.FlowShape]. It can be
materialized multiple times via its @apidoc[flow](akka.stream.SharedKillSwitch) {scala="#flow[T]:akka.stream.Graph[akka.stream.FlowShape[T,T],akka.stream.SharedKillSwitch]" java="#flow()"} method, and all materialized operators linked to it are controlled by the switch.

A @apidoc[akka.stream.UniqueKillSwitch] is always a result of a materialization, whilst @apidoc[akka.stream.SharedKillSwitch] needs to be constructed
before any materialization takes place.

## Dynamic fan-in and fan-out with MergeHub, BroadcastHub and PartitionHub

There are many cases when consumers or producers of a certain service (represented as a Sink, Source, or possibly Flow)
are dynamic and not known in advance. The Graph DSL does not allow to represent this, all connections of the graph
must be known in advance and must be connected upfront. To allow dynamic fan-in and fan-out streaming, the Hubs
should be used. They provide means to construct @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Sink] and @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Source] pairs that are "attached" to each
other, but one of them can be materialized multiple times to implement dynamic fan-in or fan-out.

### Using the MergeHub

A @apidoc[akka.stream.*.MergeHub$] allows to implement a dynamic fan-in junction point in a graph where elements coming from
different producers are emitted in a First-Comes-First-Served fashion. If the consumer cannot keep up then *all* of the
producers are backpressured. The hub itself comes as a @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Source] to which the single consumer can be attached.
It is not possible to attach any producers until this `Source` has been materialized (started). This is ensured
by the fact that we only get the corresponding @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Sink] as a materialized value. Usage might look like this:

Scala
:   @@snip [HubsDocSpec.scala](/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/stream/HubsDocSpec.scala) { #merge-hub }

Java
:   @@snip [HubDocTest.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/HubDocTest.java) { #merge-hub }

This sequence, while might look odd at first, ensures proper startup order. Once we get the `Sink`,
we can use it as many times as wanted. Everything that is fed to it will be delivered to the consumer we attached
previously until it cancels.

### Using the BroadcastHub

A @apidoc[akka.stream.*.BroadcastHub$] can be used to consume elements from a common producer by a dynamic set of consumers. The
rate of the producer will be automatically adapted to the slowest consumer. In this case, the hub is a @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Sink]
to which the single producer must be attached first. Consumers can only be attached once the `Sink` has
been materialized (i.e. the producer has been started). One example of using the `BroadcastHub`:

Scala
:   @@snip [HubsDocSpec.scala](/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/stream/HubsDocSpec.scala) { #broadcast-hub }

Java
:   @@snip [HubDocTest.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/HubDocTest.java) { #broadcast-hub }

The resulting @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Source] can be materialized any number of times, each materialization effectively attaching
a new subscriber. If there are no subscribers attached to this hub then it will not drop any elements but instead
backpressure the upstream producer until subscribers arrive. This behavior can be tweaked by using the operators
@apidoc[.buffer](akka.stream.*.Source) {scala="#buffer(size:Int,overflowStrategy:akka.stream.OverflowStrategy):FlowOps.this.Repr[Out]" java="#buffer(int,akka.stream.OverflowStrategy)"} for example with a drop strategy, or attaching a subscriber that drops all messages. If there
are no other subscribers, this will ensure that the producer is kept drained (dropping all elements) and once a new
subscriber arrives it will adaptively slow down, ensuring no more messages are dropped.

### Combining dynamic operators to build a simple Publish-Subscribe service

The features provided by the Hub implementations are limited by default. This is by design, as various combinations
can be used to express additional features like unsubscribing producers or consumers externally. We show here
an example that builds a @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Flow] representing a publish-subscribe channel. The input of the `Flow` is
published to all subscribers while the output streams all the elements published.

First, we connect a @apidoc[akka.stream.*.MergeHub$] and a @apidoc[akka.stream.*.BroadcastHub$] together to form a publish-subscribe channel. Once
we materialize this small stream, we get back a pair of @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Source] and @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Sink] that together define
the publish and subscribe sides of our channel.

Scala
:   @@snip [HubsDocSpec.scala](/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/stream/HubsDocSpec.scala) { #pub-sub-1 }

Java
:   @@snip [HubDocTest.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/HubDocTest.java) { #pub-sub-1 }

We now use a few tricks to add more features. First of all, we attach a @apidoc[Sink.ignore](akka.stream.*.Sink$) {scala="#ignore:akka.stream.scaladsl.Sink[Any,scala.concurrent.Future[akka.Done]]" java="#ignore()"}
at the broadcast side of the channel to keep it drained when there are no subscribers. If this behavior is not the
desired one this line can be dropped.

Scala
:   @@snip [HubsDocSpec.scala](/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/stream/HubsDocSpec.scala) { #pub-sub-2 }

Java
:   @@snip [HubDocTest.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/HubDocTest.java) { #pub-sub-2 }

We now wrap the @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Sink] and @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Source] in a @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Flow] using @apidoc[Flow.fromSinkAndSource](akka.stream.*.Flow$) {scala="#fromSinkAndSource[I,O](sink:akka.stream.Graph[akka.stream.SinkShape[I],_],source:akka.stream.Graph[akka.stream.SourceShape[O],_]):akka.stream.scaladsl.Flow[I,O,akka.NotUsed]" java="#fromSinkAndSource(akka.stream.Graph,akka.stream.Graph)"}. This bundles
up the two sides of the channel into one and forces users of it to always define a publisher and subscriber side
(even if the subscriber side is dropping). It also allows us to attach a @apidoc[akka.stream.KillSwitch] as
a `BidiStage` which in turn makes it possible to close both the original `Sink` and `Source` at the
same time.
Finally, we add `backpressureTimeout` on the consumer side to ensure that subscribers that block the channel for more
than 3 seconds are forcefully removed (and their stream failed).

The resulting Flow now has a type of `Flow[String, String, UniqueKillSwitch]` representing a publish-subscribe
channel which can be used any number of times to attach new producers or consumers. In addition, it materializes
to a `UniqueKillSwitch` (see @ref:[UniqueKillSwitch](#unique-kill-switch)) that can be used to deregister a single user externally:

### Using the PartitionHub

**This is a @ref:[may change](../common/may-change.md) feature***

A @apidoc[akka.stream.*.PartitionHub$] can be used to route elements from a common producer to a dynamic set of consumers.
The selection of consumer is done with a function. Each element can be routed to only one consumer. 

The rate of the producer will be automatically adapted to the slowest consumer. In this case, the hub is a @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Sink]
to which the single producer must be attached first. Consumers can only be attached once the `Sink` has
been materialized (i.e. the producer has been started). One example of using the `PartitionHub`:

Scala
:   @@snip [HubsDocSpec.scala](/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/stream/HubsDocSpec.scala) { #partition-hub }

Java
:   @@snip [HubDocTest.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/HubDocTest.java) { #partition-hub }

The `partitioner` function takes two parameters; the first is the number of active consumers and the second
is the stream element. The function should return the index of the selected consumer for the given element, 
i.e. `int` greater than or equal to 0 and less than number of consumers.

The resulting @apidoc[akka.stream.*.Source] can be materialized any number of times, each materialization effectively attaching
a new consumer. If there are no consumers attached to this hub then it will not drop any elements but instead
backpressure the upstream producer until consumers arrive. This behavior can be tweaked by using an operator,
for example @apidoc[.buffer](akka.stream.*.Source) {scala="#buffer(size:Int,overflowStrategy:akka.stream.OverflowStrategy):FlowOps.this.Repr[Out]" java="#buffer(int,akka.stream.OverflowStrategy)"} with a drop strategy, or attaching a consumer that drops all messages. If there
are no other consumers, this will ensure that the producer is kept drained (dropping all elements) and once a new
consumer arrives and messages are routed to the new consumer it will adaptively slow down, ensuring no more messages
are dropped.

It is possible to define how many initial consumers that are required before it starts emitting any messages
to the attached consumers. While not enough consumers have been attached messages are buffered and when the
buffer is full the upstream producer is backpressured. No messages are dropped.

The above example illustrate a stateless partition function. For more advanced stateful routing the @java[@javadoc[ofStateful](akka.stream.javadsl.PartitionHub$#ofStateful(java.lang.Class,java.util.function.Supplier,int))]
@scala[@scaladoc[statefulSink](akka.stream.scaladsl.PartitionHub$#statefulSink[T](partitioner:()=%3E(akka.stream.scaladsl.PartitionHub.ConsumerInfo,T)=%3ELong,startAfterNrOfConsumers:Int,bufferSize:Int):akka.stream.scaladsl.Sink[T,akka.stream.scaladsl.Source[T,akka.NotUsed]])] can be used. Here is an example of a stateful round-robin function:

Scala
:   @@snip [HubsDocSpec.scala](/akka-docs/src/test/scala/docs/stream/HubsDocSpec.scala) { #partition-hub-stateful }

Java
:   @@snip [HubDocTest.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/HubDocTest.java) { #partition-hub-stateful }

Note that it is a factory of a function to be able to hold stateful variables that are 
unique for each materialization. @java[In this example the `partitioner` function is implemented as a class to
be able to hold the mutable variable. A new instance of `RoundRobin` is created for each materialization of the hub.]

@@@ div { .group-java }
@@snip [HubDocTest.java](/akka-docs/src/test/java/jdocs/stream/HubDocTest.java) { #partition-hub-stateful-function }
@@@

The function takes two parameters; the first is information about active consumers, including an array of 
consumer identifiers and the second is the stream element. The function should return the selected consumer
identifier for the given element. The function will never be called when there are no active consumers, i.e. 
there is always at least one element in the array of identifiers.

Another interesting type of routing is to prefer routing to the fastest consumers. The @apidoc[ConsumerInfo](akka.stream.*.PartitionHub.ConsumerInfo)
has an accessor `queueSize` that is approximate number of buffered elements for a consumer.
Larger value than other consumers could be an indication of that the consumer is slow.
Note that this is a moving target since the elements are consumed concurrently. Here is an example of
a hub that routes to the consumer with least buffered elements:

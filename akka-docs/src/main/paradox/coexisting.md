# Coexistence

We believe Akka Typed will be adopted in existing systems gradually and therefore it's important to be able to use typed 
and untyped actors together, within the same `ActorSystem`. Also, we will not be able to integrate with all existing modules in one big bang release and that is another reason for why these two ways of writing actors must be able to coexist.

There are two different `ActorSystem`s: `akka.actor.ActorSystem` and `akka.actor.typed.ActorSystem`. 
The latter should only be used for greenfield projects that are only using typed actors. The `akka.actor.ActorSystem`
can be adapted so that it can create typed actors.

Currently the typed actor system is implemented using an untyped actor system under the hood. This may change in the future.

Typed and untyped can interact the following ways:

* untyped actor systems can create typed actors
* typed actors can send messages to untyped actors, and opposite
* spawn and supervise typed child from untyped parent, and opposite
* watch typed from untyped, and opposite
* untyped actor system can be converted to a typed actor system

@scala[In the examples the `akka.actor` package is aliased to `untyped`.] @java[The examples use fully qualified
class names for the untyped classes to distinguish between typed and untyped classes with the same name.]

## Untyped to typed 

While coexisting your application will likely still have an untyped ActorSystem. This can be converted to a typed ActorSystem
so that new code and migrated parts don't rely on the untyped system:

Scala
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala) { #convert-untyped }

Java
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java) { #convert-untyped }

Then for new typed actors here's how you create, watch and send messages to
it from an untyped actor.

Scala
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala) { #typed }

Java
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java) { #typed }

The top level untyped actor is created in the usual way:

Scala
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala) { #create-untyped }

Java
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java) { #create-untyped }

Then it can create a typed actor, watch it, and send a message to it:

Scala
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala) { #untyped-watch }

Java
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java) { #untyped-watch }

@scala[There is one `import` that is needed to make that work.] @java[We import the Adapter class and
call static methods for conversion.]

Scala
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedSpec.scala) { #adapter-import }

Java
:  @@snip [UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/akka/typed/coexistence/UntypedWatchingTypedTest.java) { #adapter-import }


@scala[That adds some implicit extension methods that are added to untyped and typed `ActorSystem` and `ActorContext` in both directions.]
@java[To convert between typed and untyped there are adapter methods in `akka.typed.javadsl.Adapter`.] Note the inline comments in the example above. 

## Typed to untyped

Let's turn the example upside down and first start the typed actor and then the untyped as a child.

The following will show how to create, watch and send messages back and forth from a typed actor to this
untyped actor:

Scala
:  @@snip [TypedWatchingUntypedSpec.scala]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/akka/typed/coexistence/TypedWatchingUntypedSpec.scala) { #untyped }

Java
:  @@snip [TypedWatchingUntypedTest.java]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/akka/typed/coexistence/TypedWatchingUntypedTest.java) { #untyped }

Creating the actor system and the typed actor:

Scala
:  @@snip [TypedWatchingUntypedSpec.scala]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/akka/typed/coexistence/TypedWatchingUntypedSpec.scala) { #create }

Java
:  @@snip [TypedWatchingUntypedTest.java]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/akka/typed/coexistence/TypedWatchingUntypedTest.java) { #create }

Then the typed actor creates the untyped actor, watches it and sends and receives a response:

Scala
:  @@snip [TypedWatchingUntypedSpec.scala]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/scala/docs/akka/typed/coexistence/TypedWatchingUntypedSpec.scala) { #typed }

Java
:  @@snip [TypedWatchingUntypedTest.java]($akka$/akka-actor-typed-tests/src/test/java/jdocs/akka/typed/coexistence/TypedWatchingUntypedTest.java) { #typed }

There is one caveat regarding supervision of untyped child from typed parent. If the child throws an exception we would expect it to be restarted, but supervision in Akka Typed defaults to stopping the child in case it fails. The restarting facilities in Akka Typed will not work with untyped children. However, the workaround is simply to add another untyped actor that takes care of the supervision, i.e. restarts in case of failure if that is the desired behavior.

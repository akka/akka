Akka Classic pertains to the original Actor APIs, which have been improved by more type safe and guided Actor APIs. 
Akka Classic is still fully supported and existing applications can continue to use the classic APIs. It is also
possible to use the new Actor APIs together with classic actors in the same ActorSystem, see @ref:[coexistence](typed/coexisting.md).
For new projects we recommend using @ref:[the new Actor API](typed/actors.md).

 What is Akka?
###############


**Simpler Scalability, Fault-Tolerance, Concurrency & Remoting through Actors**

We believe that writing correct concurrent, fault-tolerant and scalable
applications is too hard. Most of the time it's because we are using the wrong
tools and the wrong level of abstraction. Akka is here to change that. Using the
Actor Model together with Software Transactional Memory we raise the abstraction
level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable
applications. For fault-tolerance we adopt the Let it crash/Embrace failure
model which have been used with great success in the telecom industry to build
applications that self-heals, systems that never stop. Actors also provides the
abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and
fault-tolerant applications. Akka is Open Source and available under the Apache

Akka implements a unique hybrid
===============================

Actors
------

Actors give you:

  - Simple and high-level abstractions for concurrency and parallelism.
  - Asynchronous, non-blocking and highly performant event-driven programming model.
  - Very lightweight event-driven processes (approximately 2.7 million actors per GB RAM).

See :ref:`actors-scala` and :ref:`untyped-actors-java`

Fault Tolerance
---------------

Fault tolerance through supervisor hierarchies with "let-it-crash"
semantics. Excellent for writing highly fault-tolerant systems that never stop,
systems that self-heal.

See :ref:`fault-tolerance-scala` and :ref:`fault-tolerance-java`

Transactors
-----------

Transactors combine actors and STM (Software Transactional Memory) into transactional actors.
It allows you to compose atomic message flows with automatic retry and rollback.

See :ref:`transactors-scala` and :ref:`transactors-java`

Remote Actors
-------------

Highly performant distributed actors with remote supervision and error
management.

See :ref:`remote-actors-scala` and :ref:`remote-actors-java`.


Scala and Java APIs
===================

Akka has both a :ref:`scala-api` and a :ref:`java-api`.


Akka can be used in two different ways
======================================

- As a library: used by a web app, to be put into ‘WEB-INF/lib’ or as a regular
  JAR on your classpath.

- As a microkernel: stand-alone kernel, embedding a servlet container and all
  the other modules.

See the :ref:`deployment-scenarios` for details.

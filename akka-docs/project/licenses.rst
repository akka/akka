      Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") V2.0
               http://www.scalablesolutions.se/licenses/

  Thank you for your interest in Akka, a Typesafe Inc. (the
  "Company") Open Source project. In order to clarify the intellectual
  property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity,
  the Company must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file
  that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the
  license terms below. This license is for your protection as a
  Contributor as well as the protection of the Company and its users;
  it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any
  other purpose.

    Full name: ______________________________________________________

    Mailing Address: ________________________________________________

  You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
  present and future Contributions submitted to the Company. In
  return, the Company shall not use Your Contributions in a way that
  is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit
  status and bylaws in effect at the time of the Contribution. Except
  for the license granted herein to the Company and recipients of
  software distributed by the Company, You reserve all right, title,
  and interest in and to Your Contributions.

  1. Definitions.

     "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
     authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
     with the Company. For legal entities, the entity making a
     Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
     by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
     be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
     "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
     direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
     otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
     outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

     "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,
     including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
     is intentionally submitted by You to the Company for inclusion
     in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by
     the Company (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
     "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
     communication sent to the Company or its representatives,
     including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
     lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
     are managed by, or on behalf of, the Company for the purpose of
     discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that
     is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You
     as "Not a Contribution."

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to
     recipients of software distributed by the Company a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
     Contributions and such derivative works.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to
     recipients of software distributed by the Company a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
     made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
     Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
     licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any
     entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
     (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
     that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,
     constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
     patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for
     that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
     litigation is filed.

  4. You agree that all Contributions are and will be given entirely
     voluntarily. Company will not be required to use, or to refrain
     from using, any Contributions that You, will not, absent a
     separate written agreement signed by Company, create any
     confidentiality obligation of Company, and Company has not
     undertaken any obligation to treat any Contributions or other
     information You have given Company or will give Company in the
     future as confidential or proprietary information. Furthermore,
     except as otherwise provided in a separate subsequence written
     agreement between You and Company, Company will be free to use,
     disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit
     the Contributions as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or
     restriction of any kind on account of any proprietary or
     intellectual property rights or otherwise.

  5. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
     license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property
     that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent
     that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf
     of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for
     your Contributions to the Company, or that your employer has
     executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Company.

  6. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
     creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).  You
     represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
     details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
     but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you
     are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
     Contributions.

  7. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
     except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
     support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
     applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
     Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
     OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
     limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
     INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  8. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
     You may submit it to the Company separately from any
     Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of
     any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
     related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you
     are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
     "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

  9. You agree to notify the Company of any facts or circumstances of
     which you become aware that would make these representations
     inaccurate in any respect.

  9. The validity of the interpretation of this Agreements shall be
     governed by, and constructed and enforced in accordance with, the
     laws of Sweden, applicable to the agreements made there (excluding
     the conflict of law rules). This Agreement embodies the entire
     agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and supersedes
     any and all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings
     relating to the matters provided for herein. No alteration, waiver,
     amendment changed or supplement hereto shall be binding more
     effective unless the same as set forth in writing signed by both
     parties.

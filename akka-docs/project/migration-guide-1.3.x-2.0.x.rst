Actors
======

The 2.0 release contains several new features which require source-level
changes in client code. This API cleanup is planned to be the last one for a
significant amount of time.

Detailed migration guide will be written.

Migration Kit
=============

Nobody likes a big refactoring that takes several days to complete until
anything is able to run again. Therefore we provide a migration kit that
makes it possible to do the migration changes in smaller steps.

The migration kit only covers the most common usage of Akka. It is not intended
as a final solution. The whole migration kit is deprecated and will be removed in
Akka 2.1.

The migration kit is provided in separate jar files. Add the following dependency::

  "com.typesafe.akka" % "akka-actor-migration" % "2.0-SNAPSHOT"

Search and replace the following:

==================================== ====================================
Search                               Replace with
==================================== ====================================
``akka.actor.Actor``                 ``akka.actor.OldActor``
``akka.event.EventHandler``          ``akka.event.OldEventHandler``
``akka.config.Config``               ``akka.config.OldConfig``
==================================== ====================================

When using the migration kit there will be one global actor system, which loads
the configuration ``akka.conf`` from the same locations as in Akka 1.x.

For Scala users the migration kit also contains some implicit conversions to be
able to use some old methods::

  import akka.migration._

Unordered Collection of Migration Items
=======================================

``ActorRef.start()``
--------------------

``ActorRef.start()`` has been removed. Actors are now started automatically when created.
Remove all invocations of ``ActorRef.start()``.
There will be compilation errors for this.

``ActorRef.stop()``
--------------------

``ActorRef.start()`` has been moved. Use ``ActorSystem`` or ``ActorContext`` to stop actors.
There will be compilation errors for this.

``Channel``
-----------

``self.channel`` has been replaced with unified reply mechanism using ``sender`` (Scala)
or ``getSender()`` (Java).
There will be compilation errors for this.

``ActorRef.ask()``
------------------

The mechanism for collecting an actorâ€™s reply in a :class:`Future` has been
reworked for better location transparency: it uses an actor under the hood.
This actor needs to be disposable by the garbage collector in case no reply is
ever received, and the decision is based upon a timeout. This timeout
determines when the actor will stop itself and hence closes the window for a
reply to be received; it is independent of the timeout applied when awaiting
completion of the :class:`Future`, however, the actor will complete the
:class:`Future` with an :class:`AskTimeoutException` when it stops itself.

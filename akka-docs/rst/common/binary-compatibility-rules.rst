Binary Compatibility Rules
##########################

Akka maintains and verifies *backwards binary compatibility* across versions of modules.

In the rest of this document whenever *binary compatibility* is mentioned "*backwards binary compatibility*" is meant
(as opposed to forward compatibility).

This means that the new JARs are a drop-in replacement for the old one 
(but not the other way around) as long as your build does not enable the inliner (Scala-only restriction).

Binary compatibility rules explained
====================================
Binary compatibility is maintained between:

- **minor** and **patch** versions - please note that the meaning of "minor" has shifted to be more restrictive with Akka ``2.4.0``, read :ref:`24versioningChange` for details.

Binary compatibility is **NOT** maintained between:

- **major** versions
- any versions of **experimental** modules â€“ read :ref:`meaning-of-experimental` for details
- a few notable exclusions explained below

Specific examples (please read :ref:`24versioningChange` to understand the difference in "before 2.4 era" and "after 2.4 era")::

  # [epoch.major.minor] era
  OK:  2.2.0 --> 2.2.1 --> ... --> 2.2.x
  NO:  2.2.y --x 2.3.y
  OK:  2.3.0 --> 2.3.1 --> ... --> 2.3.x
  OK:  2.3.x --> 2.4.x (special case, migration to new versioning scheme)
  # [major.minor.path] era
  OK:  2.4.0 --> 2.5.x
  OK:  2.5.0 --> 2.6.x
  NO:  2.x.y --x 3.x.y
  OK:  3.0.0 --> 3.0.1 --> ... --> 3.0.n
  OK:  3.0.n --> 3.1.0 --> ... --> 3.1.n
  OK:  3.1.n --> 3.2.0 ...
       ...

Cases where binary compatibility is not retained
------------------------------------------------
Some modules are excluded from the binary compatibility guarantees, such as:

  - ``*-testkit`` modules - since these are to be used only in tests, which usually are re-compiled and run on demand
  - ``*-tck`` modules     - since they may want to add new tests (or force configuring something), in order to discover possible 
                            failures in an existing implementation that the TCK is supposed to be testing. 
                            Compatibility here is not *guaranteed*, however it is attempted to make the upgrade prosess as smooth as possible.
  - all :ref:`experimental <meaning-of-experimental>` modules - which by definition are subject to rapid iteration and change. Read more about them in :ref:`meaning-of-experimental`

.. _24versioningChange:

Change in versioning scheme, stronger compatibility since 2.4
=============================================================
Since the release of Akka ``2.4.0`` a new versioning scheme is in effect.

Historically, Akka has been following the Java or Scala style of versioning where as the first number would mean "**epoch**",
the second one would mean **major**, and third be the **minor**, thus: ``epoch.major.minor`` (versioning scheme followed until and during ``2.3.x``).

**Currently**, since Akka ``2.4.0``, the new versioning applies which is closer to semantic versioning many have come to expect, 
in which the version number is deciphered as ``major.minor.patch``. 

In addition to that, Akka ``2.4.x`` has been made binary compatible with the ``2.3.x`` series,
so there is no reason to remain on Akka 2.3.x, since upgrading is completely compatible 
(and many issues have been fixed ever since).

Mixed versioning is not allowed
===============================

Modules that are released together under the Akka project are intended to be upgraded together.
For example, it is not legal to mix Akka Actor ``2.4.2`` with Akka Cluster ``2.4.5`` even though
"Akka ``2.4.2``" and "Akka ``2.4.5``" *are* binary compatible. 

This is because modules may assume internals changes across module boundaries, for example some feature
in Clustering may have required an internals change in Actor, however it is not public API, 
thus such change is considered safe.

.. note::
  We recommend keeping an ``akkaVersion`` variable in your build file, and re-use it for all 
  included modules, so when you upgrade you can simply change it in this one place.

.. _meaning-of-experimental:

The meaning of "experimental"
=============================
**Experimental** is a keyword used in module descriptions as well as their artifact names,
in order to signify that the API that they contain is subject to change without any prior warning.

Experimental modules are are not covered by Lightbend's Commercial Support, unless specifically stated otherwise.
The purpose of releasing them early, as 
experimental, is to make them easily available and improve based on 
feedback, or even discover that the module wasn't useful.

An experimental module doesn't have to obey the rule of staying binary
compatible between micro releases. Breaking API changes may be introduced
in minor releases without notice as we refine and simplify based on your
feedback. An experimental module may be dropped in minor releases without 
prior deprecation.

Best effort migration guides may be provided, but this is decided on a case-by-case basis for **experimental** modules.

The meaning of INTERNAL API
===========================
When browsing the source code and/or looking for methods available to be called, especially from Java which does not
have as rich of an access protection system as Scala has, you may sometimes find methods or classes annotated with
the ``/** INTERNAL API */`` comment. 

No compatibility guarantees are given about these classes, they may change or even disapear in minor versions, 
and user code is not supposed to be calling (or even touching) them.

Side-note on JVM representation details of the Scala ``private[akka]`` pattern that Akka is using extensively in 
it's internals: Such methods or classes, which act as "accessible only from the given package" in Scala, are compiled
down to ``public`` (!) in raw Java bytecode, and the access restriction, that Scala understands is carried along 
as metadata stored in the classfile. Thus, such methods are safely guarded from being accessed from Scala,
however Java users will not be warned about this fact by the ``javac`` compiler. Please be aware of this and do not call
into Internal APIs, as they are subject to change without any warning.

Binary Compatibility Checking Toolchain
=======================================
Akka uses the Lightbend maintained `Migration Manager <https://github.com/typesafehub/migration-manager>`_, 
called ``MiMa`` for short, for enforcing binary compatibility is kept where it was promised.

All Pull Requests must pass MiMa validation (which happens automatically), and if failures are detected,
manual exception overrides may be put in place if the change happened to be in an Internal API for example.

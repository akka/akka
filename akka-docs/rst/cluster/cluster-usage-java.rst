.. note:: This module is :ref:`experimental <experimental>`. This document describes how to use the features implemented so far. More features are coming in Akka Coltrane. Track progress of the Coltrane milestone in `Assembla <http://www.assembla.com/spaces/akka/tickets>`_ and the `Roadmap <https://docs.google.com/document/d/18W9-fKs55wiFNjXL9q50PYOnR7-nnsImzJqHOPPbM4E/edit?hl=en_US>`_.

For introduction to the Akka Cluster concepts please see :ref:`cluster`.

Preparing Your Project for Clustering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Akka cluster is a separate jar file. Make sure that you have the following dependency in your project::

  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.typesafe.akka</groupId>
    <artifactId>akka-cluster-experimental_@binVersion@</artifactId>
    <version>@version@</version>
  </dependency>

If you are using the latest nightly build you should pick a timestamped Akka
version from
`<http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/snapshots/com/typesafe/akka/akka-cluster-experimental_@binVersion@/>`_.
We recommend against using ``SNAPSHOT`` in order to obtain stable builds.

.. _cluster_simple_example_java:

A Simple Cluster Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following small program together with its configuration starts an ``ActorSystem``
with the Cluster extension enabled. It joins the cluster and logs some membership events.

Try it out:

1. Add the following ``application.conf`` in your project, place it in ``src/main/resources``:


.. literalinclude:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/resources/application.conf
   :language: none

To enable cluster capabilities in your Akka project you should, at a minimum, add the :ref:`remoting-java`
settings, but with ``akka.cluster.ClusterActorRefProvider``.
The ``akka.cluster.seed-nodes`` and cluster extension should normally also be added to your
``application.conf`` file.

The seed nodes are configured contact points for initial, automatic, join of the cluster.

Note that if you are going to start the nodes on different machines you need to specify the
ip-addresses or host names of the machines in ``application.conf`` instead of ``127.0.0.1``

2. Add the following main program to your project, place it in ``src/main/java``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/simple/japi/SimpleClusterApp.java
   :language: java

3. Add `maven exec plugin <http://mojo.codehaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/introduction.html>`_ to your pom.xml::

    <project>
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
              <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
              <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
              <version>1.2.1</version>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </project>


4. Start the first seed node. Open a terminal window and run (one line)::

    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.simple.japi.SimpleClusterApp" \
      -Dexec.args="2551"

2551 corresponds to the port of the first seed-nodes element in the configuration.
In the log output you see that the cluster node has been started and changed status to 'Up'.

5. Start the second seed node. Open another terminal window and run::

    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.simple.japi.SimpleClusterApp" \
      -Dexec.args="2552"


2552 corresponds to the port of the second seed-nodes element in the configuration.
In the log output you see that the cluster node has been started and joins the other seed node
and becomes a member of the cluster. It's status changed to 'Up'.

Switch over to the first terminal window and see in the log output that the member joined.

6. Start another node. Open a sbt session in yet another terminal window and run::

    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.simple.japi.SimpleClusterApp"

Now you don't need to specify the port number, and it will use a random available port.
It joins one of the configured seed nodes. Look at the log output in the different terminal
windows.

Start even more nodes in the same way, if you like.

6. Shut down one of the nodes by pressing 'ctrl-c' in one of the terminal windows.
The other nodes will detect the failure after a while, which you can see in the log
output in the other terminals.

Look at the source code of the program again. What it does is to create an actor
and register it as subscriber of certain cluster events. It gets notified with
an snapshot event, ``CurrentClusterState`` that holds full state information of
the cluster. After that it receives events for changes that happen in the cluster.

Automatic vs. Manual Joining
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may decide if joining to the cluster should be done automatically or manually.
By default it is automatic and you need to define the seed nodes in configuration
so that a new node has an initial contact point. When a new node is started it
sends a message to all seed nodes and then sends join command to the one that
answers first. If no one of the seed nodes replied (might not be started yet)
it retries this procedure until successful or shutdown.

There is one thing to be aware of regarding the seed node configured as the
first element in the ``seed-nodes`` configuration list.
The seed nodes can be started in any order and it is not necessary to have all
seed nodes running, but the first seed node must be started when initially
starting a cluster, otherwise the other seed-nodes will not become initialized
and no other node can join the cluster. Once more than two seed nodes have been
started it is no problem to shut down the first seed node. If it goes down it
must be manually joined to the cluster again.
Automatic joining of the first seed node is not possible, it would only join
itself. It is only the first seed node that has this restriction.

You can disable automatic joining with configuration::

      akka.cluster.auto-join = off

Then you need to join manually, using :ref:`cluster_jmx_java` or :ref:`cluster_command_line_java`.
You can join to any node in the cluster. It doesn't have to be configured as
seed node. If you are not using auto-join there is no need to configure
seed nodes at all.

Joining can also be performed programatically with ``Cluster.get(system).join(address)``.


Automatic vs. Manual Downing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a member is considered by the failure detector to be unreachable the
leader is not allowed to perform its duties, such as changing status of
new joining members to 'Up'. The status of the unreachable member must be
changed to 'Down'. This can be performed automatically or manually. By
default it must be done manually, using using :ref:`cluster_jmx_java` or
:ref:`cluster_command_line_java`.

It can also be performed programatically with ``Cluster.get(system).down(address)``.

You can enable automatic downing with configuration::

      akka.cluster.auto-down = on

Be aware of that using auto-down implies that two separate clusters will
automatically be formed in case of network partition. That might be
desired by some applications but not by others.

.. _cluster_subscriber_java:

Subscribe to Cluster Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can subscribe to change notifications of the cluster membership by using
``Cluster.get(system).subscribe(subscriber, to)``. A snapshot of the full state,
``akka.cluster.ClusterEvent.CurrentClusterState``, is sent to the subscriber
as the first event, followed by events for incremental updates.

There are several types of change events, consult the API documentation
of classes that extends ``akka.cluster.ClusterEvent.ClusterDomainEvent``
for details about the events.

Worker Dial-in Example
----------------------

Let's take a look at an example that illustrates how workers, here named *backend*,
can detect and register to new master nodes, here named *frontend*.

The example application provides a service to transform text. When some text
is sent to one of the frontend services, it will be delegated to one of the
backend workers, which performs the transformation job, and sends the result back to
the original client. New backend nodes, as well as new frontend nodes, can be
added or removed to the cluster dynamically.

In this example the following imports are used:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/transformation/japi/TransformationBackend.java#imports

Messages:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/transformation/japi/TransformationMessages.java#messages

The backend worker that performs the transformation job:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/transformation/japi/TransformationBackend.java#backend

Note that the ``TransformationBackend`` actor subscribes to cluster events to detect new,
potential, frontend nodes, and send them a registration message so that they know
that they can use the backend worker.

The frontend that receives user jobs and delegates to one of the registered backend workers:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/transformation/japi/TransformationFrontend.java#frontend

Note that the ``TransformationFrontend`` actor watch the registered backend
to be able to remove it from its list of availble backend workers.
Death watch uses the cluster failure detector for nodes in the cluster, i.e. it detects
network failures and JVM crashes, in addition to graceful termination of watched
actor.

This example is included in ``akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster`` and you can try it by copying the 
`source <@github@/akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster>`_ to your
maven project, defined as in :ref:`cluster_simple_example_java`.
Run it by starting nodes in different terminal windows. For example, starting 2
frontend nodes and 3 backend nodes::

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.transformation.japi.TransformationFrontendMain" \
    -Dexec.args="2551"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.transformation.japi.TransformationBackendMain" \
    -Dexec.args="2552"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.transformation.japi.TransformationBackendMain"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.transformation.japi.TransformationBackendMain"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.transformation.japi.TransformationFrontendMain"


.. note:: The above example should probably be designed as two separate, frontend/backend, clusters, when there is a `cluster client for decoupling clusters <https://www.assembla.com/spaces/akka/tickets/1165>`_.

Failure Detector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The nodes in the cluster monitor each other by sending heartbeats to detect if a node is
unreachable from the rest of the cluster. The heartbeat arrival times is interpreted
by an implementation of
`The Phi Accrual Failure Detector <http://ddg.jaist.ac.jp/pub/HDY+04.pdf>`_.

The suspicion level of failure is given by a value called *phi*.
The basic idea of the phi failure detector is to express the value of *phi* on a scale that
is dynamically adjusted to reflect current network conditions.

The value of *phi* is calculated as::

  phi = -log10(1 - F(timeSinceLastHeartbeat))

where F is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution with mean
and standard deviation estimated from historical heartbeat inter-arrival times.

In the :ref:`cluster_configuration_java` you can adjust the ``akka.cluster.failure-detector.threshold``
to define when a *phi* value is considered to be a failure.

A low ``threshold`` is prone to generate many false positives but ensures
a quick detection in the event of a real crash. Conversely, a high ``threshold``
generates fewer mistakes but needs more time to detect actual crashes. The
default ``threshold`` is 8 and is appropriate for most situations. However in
cloud environments, such as Amazon EC2, the value could be increased to 12 in
order to account for network issues that sometimes occur on such platforms.

The following chart illustrates how *phi* increase with increasing time since the
previous heartbeat.

.. image:: images/phi1.png

Phi is calculated from the mean and standard deviation of historical
inter arrival times. The previous chart is an example for standard deviation
of 200 ms. If the heartbeats arrive with less deviation the curve becomes steeper,
i.e. it's possible to determine failure more quickly. The curve looks like this for
a standard deviation of 100 ms.

.. image:: images/phi2.png

To be able to survive sudden abnormalities, such as garbage collection pauses and
transient network failures the failure detector is configured with a margin,
``akka.cluster.failure-detector.acceptable-heartbeat-pause``. You may want to
adjust the :ref:`cluster_configuration_java` of this depending on you environment.
This is how the curve looks like for ``acceptable-heartbeat-pause`` configured to
3 seconds.

Cluster Aware Routers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All :ref:`routers <routing-java>` can be made aware of member nodes in the cluster, i.e.
deploying new routees or looking up routees on nodes in the cluster.
When a node becomes unavailble or leaves the cluster the routees of that node are
automatically unregistered from the router. When new nodes join the cluster additional
routees are added to the router, according to the configuration.

When using a router with routees looked up on the cluster member nodes, i.e. the routees
are already running, the configuration for a router looks like this:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSpec.scala#router-lookup-config

It's the relative actor path defined in ``routees-path`` that identify what actor to lookup.

``nr-of-instances`` defines total number of routees in the cluster, but there will not be
more than one per node. Setting ``nr-of-instances`` to a high value will result in new routees
added to the router when nodes join the cluster.

The same type of router could also have been defined in code:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsService.java#router-lookup-in-code

When using a router with routees created and deployed on the cluster member nodes
the configuration for a router looks like this:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSingleMasterSpec.scala#router-deploy-config


``nr-of-instances`` defines total number of routees in the cluster, but the number of routees
per node, ``max-nr-of-instances-per-node``, will not be exceeded. Setting ``nr-of-instances``
to a high value will result in creating and deploying additional routees when new nodes join
the cluster.

The same type of router could also have been defined in code:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsService.java#router-deploy-in-code

See :ref:`cluster_configuration_java` section for further descriptions of the settings.


Router Example
--------------

Let's take a look at how to use cluster aware routers.

The example application provides a service to calculate statistics for a text.
When some text is sent to the service it splits it into words, and delegates the task
to count number of characters in each word to a separate worker, a routee of a router.
The character count for each word is sent back to an aggregator that calculates
the average number of characters per word when all results have been collected.

In this example we use the following imports:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsService.java#imports

Messages:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsMessages.java#messages

The worker that counts number of characters in each word:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsWorker.java#worker

The service that receives text from users and splits it up into words, delegates to workers and aggregates:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsService.java#service

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsAggregator.java#aggregator


Note, nothing cluster specific so far, just plain actors.

We can use these actors with two different types of router setup. Either with lookup of routees,
or with create and deploy of routees. Remember, routees are the workers in this case.

We start with the router setup with lookup of routees. All nodes start ``StatsService`` and
``StatsWorker`` actors and the router is configured with ``routees-path``:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsSampleMain.java#start-router-lookup

This means that user requests can be sent to ``StatsService`` on any node and it will use
``StatsWorker`` on all nodes. There can only be one worker per node, but that worker could easily
fan out to local children if more parallelism is needed.

This example is included in ``akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster`` and you can try it by copying the 
`source <@github@/akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster>`_ to your
maven project, defined as in :ref:`cluster_simple_example_java`.
Run it by starting nodes in different terminal windows. For example, starting 3
service nodes and 1 client::

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="run-main sample.cluster.stats.japi.StatsSampleMain" \
    -Dexec.args="2551"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="run-main sample.cluster.stats.japi.StatsSampleMain" \
    -Dexec.args="2552"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="run-main sample.cluster.stats.japi.StatsSampleMain"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="run-main sample.cluster.stats.japi.StatsSampleMain"


The above setup is nice for this example, but we will also take a look at how to use
a single master node that creates and deploys workers. To keep track of a single
master we need one additional actor:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsFacade.java#facade

The ``StatsFacade`` receives text from users and delegates to the current ``StatsService``, the single
master. It listens to cluster events to create or lookup the ``StatsService`` depending on if
it is on the same same node or on another node. We run the master on the same node as the leader of
the cluster members, which is nothing more than the address currently sorted first in the member ring,
i.e. it can change when new nodes join or when current leader leaves.

All nodes start ``StatsFacade`` and the router is now configured like this:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/java/sample/cluster/stats/japi/StatsSampleOneMasterMain.java#start-router-deploy

This example is included in ``akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster`` and you can try it by copying the 
`source <@github@/akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster>`_ to your
maven project, defined as in :ref:`cluster_simple_example_java`.
Run it by starting nodes in different terminal windows. For example, starting 3
service nodes and 1 client::

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.stats.japi.StatsSampleOneMasterMain" \
    -Dexec.args="2551"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.stats.japi.StatsSampleOneMasterMain" \
    -Dexec.args="2552"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.stats.japi.StatsSampleOneMasterClientMain"

  mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="sample.cluster.stats.japi.StatsSampleOneMasterMain"


.. note:: The above example, especially the last part, will be simplified when the cluster handles automatic actor partitioning.


.. _cluster_jmx_java:

JMX
^^^

Information and management of the cluster is available as JMX MBeans with the root name ``akka.Cluster``.
The JMX information can be displayed with an ordinary JMX console such as JConsole or JVisualVM.

From JMX you can:

* see what members that are part of the cluster
* see status of this node
* join this node to another node in cluster
* mark any node in the cluster as down
* tell any node in the cluster to leave

Member nodes are identified with their address, in format `akka://actor-system-name@hostname:port`.

.. _cluster_command_line_java:

Command Line Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cluster can be managed with the script `bin/akka-cluster` provided in the
Akka distribution.

Run it without parameters to see instructions about how to use the script::

  Usage: bin/akka-cluster <node-hostname:jmx-port> <command> ...

  Supported commands are:
             join <node-url> - Sends request a JOIN node with the specified URL
            leave <node-url> - Sends a request for node with URL to LEAVE the cluster
             down <node-url> - Sends a request for marking node with URL as DOWN
               member-status - Asks the member node for its current status
              cluster-status - Asks the cluster for its current status (member ring,
                               unavailable nodes, meta data etc.)
                      leader - Asks the cluster who the current leader is
                is-singleton - Checks if the cluster is a singleton cluster (single
                               node cluster)
                is-available - Checks if the member node is available
                  is-running - Checks if the member node is running
             has-convergence - Checks if there is a cluster convergence
  Where the <node-url> should be on the format of 
    'akka://actor-system-name@hostname:port'

  Examples: bin/akka-cluster localhost:9999 is-available
            bin/akka-cluster localhost:9999 join akka://MySystem@darkstar:2552
            bin/akka-cluster localhost:9999 cluster-status


To be able to use the script you must enable remote monitoring and management when starting the JVMs of the cluster nodes,
as described in `Monitoring and Management Using JMX Technology <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html>`_

Example of system properties to enable remote monitoring and management::

  java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999 \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false

.. _cluster_configuration_java:

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several configuration properties for the cluster. We refer to the following
reference file for more information:


.. literalinclude:: ../../../akka-cluster/src/main/resources/reference.conf
   :language: none

Cluster Scheduler
-----------------

It is recommended that you change the ``tick-duration`` to 33 ms or less
of the default scheduler when using cluster, if you don't need to have it
configured to a longer duration for other reasons. If you don't do this
a dedicated scheduler will be used for periodic tasks of the cluster, which
introduce the extra overhead of another thread.

::

  # shorter tick-duration of default scheduler when using cluster
  akka.scheduler.tick-duration.tick-duration = 33ms

.. note:: This module is :ref:`experimental <experimental>`. This document describes how to use the features implemented so far. More features are coming in Akka Coltrane. Track progress of the Coltrane milestone in `Assembla <http://www.assembla.com/spaces/akka/tickets>`_ and the `Roadmap <https://docs.google.com/document/d/18W9-fKs55wiFNjXL9q50PYOnR7-nnsImzJqHOPPbM4E/edit?hl=en_US>`_.

For introduction to the Akka Cluster concepts please see :ref:`cluster`.

Preparing Your Project for Clustering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Akka cluster is a separate jar file. Make sure that you have the following dependency in your project::

  "com.typesafe.akka" %% "akka-cluster-experimental" % "@version@" @crossString@

If you are using the latest nightly build you should pick a timestamped Akka
version from
`<http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/snapshots/com/typesafe/akka/akka-cluster-experimental_@binVersion@/>`_.
We recommend against using ``SNAPSHOT`` in order to obtain stable builds.

A Simple Cluster Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following small program together with its configuration starts an ``ActorSystem``
with the Cluster extension enabled. It joins the cluster and logs some membership events.

Try it out:

1. Add the following ``application.conf`` in your project, place it in ``src/main/resources``:


.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/resources/application.conf#cluster

To enable cluster capabilities in your Akka project you should, at a minimum, add the :ref:`remoting-scala`
settings, but with ``akka.cluster.ClusterActorRefProvider``.
The ``akka.cluster.seed-nodes`` and cluster extension should normally also be added to your
``application.conf`` file.

The seed nodes are configured contact points for initial, automatic, join of the cluster.

Note that if you are going to start the nodes on different machines you need to specify the
ip-addresses or host names of the machines in ``application.conf`` instead of ``127.0.0.1``

2. Add the following main program to your project, place it in ``src/main/scala``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/simple/SimpleClusterApp.scala
   :language: scala


3. Start the first seed node. Open a sbt session in one terminal window and run::

     run-main sample.cluster.simple.SimpleClusterApp 2551

2551 corresponds to the port of the first seed-nodes element in the configuration.
In the log output you see that the cluster node has been started and changed status to 'Up'.

4. Start the second seed node. Open a sbt session in another terminal window and run::

      run-main sample.cluster.simple.SimpleClusterApp 2552


2552 corresponds to the port of the second seed-nodes element in the configuration.
In the log output you see that the cluster node has been started and joins the other seed node
and becomes a member of the cluster. It's status changed to 'Up'.

Switch over to the first terminal window and see in the log output that the member joined.

5. Start another node. Open a sbt session in yet another terminal window and run::

      run-main sample.cluster.simple.SimpleClusterApp

Now you don't need to specify the port number, and it will use a random available port.
It joins one of the configured seed nodes. Look at the log output in the different terminal
windows.

Start even more nodes in the same way, if you like.

6. Shut down one of the nodes by pressing 'ctrl-c' in one of the terminal windows.
The other nodes will detect the failure after a while, which you can see in the log
output in the other terminals.

Look at the source code of the program again. What it does is to create an actor
and register it as subscriber of certain cluster events. It gets notified with
an snapshot event, ``CurrentClusterState`` that holds full state information of
the cluster. After that it receives events for changes that happen in the cluster.

Automatic vs. Manual Joining
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may decide if joining to the cluster should be done automatically or manually.
By default it is automatic and you need to define the seed nodes in configuration
so that a new node has an initial contact point. When a new node is started it
sends a message to all seed nodes and then sends join command to the one that
answers first. If no one of the seed nodes replied (might not be started yet)
it retries this procedure until successful or shutdown.

There is one thing to be aware of regarding the seed node configured as the
first element in the ``seed-nodes`` configuration list.
The seed nodes can be started in any order and it is not necessary to have all
seed nodes running, but the first seed node must be started when initially
starting a cluster, otherwise the other seed-nodes will not become initialized
and no other node can join the cluster. Once more than two seed nodes have been
started it is no problem to shut down the first seed node. If it goes down it
must be manually joined to the cluster again.
Automatic joining of the first seed node is not possible, it would only join
itself. It is only the first seed node that has this restriction.

You can disable automatic joining with configuration::

      akka.cluster.auto-join = off

Then you need to join manually, using :ref:`cluster_jmx_scala` or :ref:`cluster_command_line_scala`.
You can join to any node in the cluster. It doesn't have to be configured as
seed node. If you are not using auto-join there is no need to configure
seed nodes at all.

Joining can also be performed programatically with ``Cluster(system).join(address)``.


Automatic vs. Manual Downing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a member is considered by the failure detector to be unreachable the
leader is not allowed to perform its duties, such as changing status of
new joining members to 'Up'. The status of the unreachable member must be
changed to 'Down'. This can be performed automatically or manually. By
default it must be done manually, using using :ref:`cluster_jmx_scala` or
:ref:`cluster_command_line_scala`.

It can also be performed programatically with ``Cluster(system).down(address)``.

You can enable automatic downing with configuration::

      akka.cluster.auto-down = on

Be aware of that using auto-down implies that two separate clusters will
automatically be formed in case of network partition. That might be
desired by some applications but not by others.

.. _cluster_subscriber_scala:

Subscribe to Cluster Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can subscribe to change notifications of the cluster membership by using
``Cluster(system).subscribe(subscriber, to)``. A snapshot of the full state,
``akka.cluster.ClusterEvent.CurrentClusterState``, is sent to the subscriber
as the first event, followed by events for incremental updates.

There are several types of change events, consult the API documentation
of classes that extends ``akka.cluster.ClusterEvent.ClusterDomainEvent``
for details about the events.

Worker Dial-in Example
----------------------

Let's take a look at an example that illustrates how workers, here named *backend*,
can detect and register to new master nodes, here named *frontend*.

The example application provides a service to transform text. When some text
is sent to one of the frontend services, it will be delegated to one of the
backend workers, which performs the transformation job, and sends the result back to
the original client. New backend nodes, as well as new frontend nodes, can be
added or removed to the cluster dynamically.

In this example the following imports are used:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/transformation/TransformationSample.scala#imports

Messages:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/transformation/TransformationSample.scala#messages

The backend worker that performs the transformation job:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/transformation/TransformationSample.scala#backend

Note that the ``TransformationBackend`` actor subscribes to cluster events to detect new,
potential, frontend nodes, and send them a registration message so that they know
that they can use the backend worker.

The frontend that receives user jobs and delegates to one of the registered backend workers:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/transformation/TransformationSample.scala#frontend

Note that the ``TransformationFrontend`` actor watch the registered backend
to be able to remove it from its list of availble backend workers.
Death watch uses the cluster failure detector for nodes in the cluster, i.e. it detects
network failures and JVM crashes, in addition to graceful termination of watched
actor.

This example is included in ``akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster``
and you can try by starting nodes in different terminal windows. For example, starting 2
frontend nodes and 3 backend nodes::

  sbt

  project akka-sample-cluster-experimental

  run-main sample.cluster.transformation.TransformationFrontend 2551

  run-main sample.cluster.transformation.TransformationBackend 2552

  run-main sample.cluster.transformation.TransformationBackend

  run-main sample.cluster.transformation.TransformationBackend

  run-main sample.cluster.transformation.TransformationFrontend


.. note:: The above example should probably be designed as two separate, frontend/backend, clusters, when there is a `cluster client for decoupling clusters <https://www.assembla.com/spaces/akka/tickets/1165>`_.

Failure Detector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The nodes in the cluster monitor each other by sending heartbeats to detect if a node is
unreachable from the rest of the cluster. The heartbeat arrival times is interpreted
by an implementation of
`The Phi Accrual Failure Detector <http://ddg.jaist.ac.jp/pub/HDY+04.pdf>`_.

The suspicion level of failure is given by a value called *phi*.
The basic idea of the phi failure detector is to express the value of *phi* on a scale that
is dynamically adjusted to reflect current network conditions.

The value of *phi* is calculated as::

  phi = -log10(1 - F(timeSinceLastHeartbeat))

where F is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution with mean
and standard deviation estimated from historical heartbeat inter-arrival times.

In the :ref:`cluster_configuration_scala` you can adjust the ``akka.cluster.failure-detector.threshold``
to define when a *phi* value is considered to be a failure.

A low ``threshold`` is prone to generate many false positives but ensures
a quick detection in the event of a real crash. Conversely, a high ``threshold``
generates fewer mistakes but needs more time to detect actual crashes. The
default ``threshold`` is 8 and is appropriate for most situations. However in
cloud environments, such as Amazon EC2, the value could be increased to 12 in
order to account for network issues that sometimes occur on such platforms.

The following chart illustrates how *phi* increase with increasing time since the
previous heartbeat.

.. image:: images/phi1.png

Phi is calculated from the mean and standard deviation of historical
inter arrival times. The previous chart is an example for standard deviation
of 200 ms. If the heartbeats arrive with less deviation the curve becomes steeper,
i.e. it's possible to determine failure more quickly. The curve looks like this for
a standard deviation of 100 ms.

.. image:: images/phi2.png

To be able to survive sudden abnormalities, such as garbage collection pauses and
transient network failures the failure detector is configured with a margin,
``akka.cluster.failure-detector.acceptable-heartbeat-pause``. You may want to
adjust the :ref:`cluster_configuration_scala` of this depending on you environment.
This is how the curve looks like for ``acceptable-heartbeat-pause`` configured to
3 seconds.

.. image:: images/phi3.png

.. _cluster_aware_routers_scala:

Cluster Aware Routers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All :ref:`routers <routing-scala>` can be made aware of member nodes in the cluster, i.e.
deploying new routees or looking up routees on nodes in the cluster.
When a node becomes unavailble or leaves the cluster the routees of that node are
automatically unregistered from the router. When new nodes join the cluster additional
routees are added to the router, according to the configuration.

When using a router with routees looked up on the cluster member nodes, i.e. the routees
are already running, the configuration for a router looks like this:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSpec.scala#router-lookup-config

It's the relative actor path defined in ``routees-path`` that identify what actor to lookup.

``nr-of-instances`` defines total number of routees in the cluster, but there will not be
more than one per node. Setting ``nr-of-instances`` to a high value will result in new routees
added to the router when nodes join the cluster.

The same type of router could also have been defined in code:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSample.scala#router-lookup-in-code

When using a router with routees created and deployed on the cluster member nodes
the configuration for a router looks like this:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSingleMasterSpec.scala#router-deploy-config


``nr-of-instances`` defines total number of routees in the cluster, but the number of routees
per node, ``max-nr-of-instances-per-node``, will not be exceeded. Setting ``nr-of-instances``
to a high value will result in creating and deploying additional routees when new nodes join
the cluster.

The same type of router could also have been defined in code:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSample.scala#router-deploy-in-code

See :ref:`cluster_configuration_scala` section for further descriptions of the settings.


Router Example
--------------

Let's take a look at how to use cluster aware routers.

The example application provides a service to calculate statistics for a text.
When some text is sent to the service it splits it into words, and delegates the task
to count number of characters in each word to a separate worker, a routee of a router.
The character count for each word is sent back to an aggregator that calculates
the average number of characters per word when all results have been collected.

In this example we use the following imports:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSample.scala#imports

Messages:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSample.scala#messages

The worker that counts number of characters in each word:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSample.scala#worker

The service that receives text from users and splits it up into words, delegates to workers and aggregates:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSample.scala#service


Note, nothing cluster specific so far, just plain actors.

We can use these actors with two different types of router setup. Either with lookup of routees,
or with create and deploy of routees. Remember, routees are the workers in this case.

We start with the router setup with lookup of routees. All nodes start ``StatsService`` and
``StatsWorker`` actors and the router is configured with ``routees-path``:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSample.scala#start-router-lookup

This means that user requests can be sent to ``StatsService`` on any node and it will use
``StatsWorker`` on all nodes. There can only be one worker per node, but that worker could easily
fan out to local children if more parallelism is needed.

This example is included in ``akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster``
and you can try by starting nodes in different terminal windows. For example, starting 3
service nodes and 1 client::

  sbt

  project akka-sample-cluster-experimental

  run-main sample.cluster.stats.StatsSample 2551

  run-main sample.cluster.stats.StatsSample 2552

  run-main sample.cluster.stats.StatsSampleClient

  run-main sample.cluster.stats.StatsSample

The above setup is nice for this example, but we will also take a look at how to use
a single master node that creates and deploys workers. To keep track of a single
master we need one additional actor:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSample.scala#facade

The ``StatsFacade`` receives text from users and delegates to the current ``StatsService``, the single
master. It listens to cluster events to create or lookup the ``StatsService`` depending on if
it is on the same same node or on another node. We run the master on the same node as the leader of
the cluster members, which is nothing more than the address currently sorted first in the member ring,
i.e. it can change when new nodes join or when current leader leaves.

All nodes start ``StatsFacade`` and the router is now configured like this:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSample.scala#start-router-deploy


This example is included in ``akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster``
and you can try by starting nodes in different terminal windows. For example, starting 3
service nodes and 1 client::

  run-main sample.cluster.stats.StatsSampleOneMaster 2551

  run-main sample.cluster.stats.StatsSampleOneMaster 2552

  run-main sample.cluster.stats.StatsSampleOneMasterClient

  run-main sample.cluster.stats.StatsSampleOneMaster

.. note:: The above example, especially the last part, will be simplified when the cluster handles automatic actor partitioning.


Cluster Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The member nodes of the cluster collects system health metrics and publishes that to other nodes and to 
registered subscribers. This information is primarily used for load-balancing routers.

Hyperic Sigar
-------------

The built-in metrics is gathered from JMX MBeans, and optionally you can use `Hyperic Sigar <http://www.hyperic.com/products/sigar>`_
for a wider and more accurate range of metrics compared to what can be retrieved from ordinary MBeans.
Sigar is using a native OS library. To enable usage of Sigar you need to add the directory of the native library to 
``-Djava.libarary.path=<path_of_sigar_libs>`` add the following dependency::

    "org.hyperic" % "sigar" % "@sigarVersion@"
 

Adaptive Load Balancing
-----------------------

The ``AdaptiveLoadBalancingRouter`` performs load balancing of messages to cluster nodes based on the cluster metrics data.
It uses random selection of routees with probabilities derived from the remaining capacity of the corresponding node.
It can be configured to use a specific MetricsSelector to produce the probabilities, a.k.a. weights:

* ``heap`` / ``HeapMetricsSelector`` - Used and max JVM heap memory. Weights based on remaining heap capacity; (max - used) / max
* ``load`` / ``SystemLoadAverageMetricsSelector`` - System load average for the past 1 minute, corresponding value can be found in ``top`` of Linux systems. The system is possibly nearing a bottleneck if the system load average is nearing number of cpus/cores. Weights based on remaining load capacity; 1 - (load / processors) 
* ``cpu`` / ``CpuMetricsSelector`` - CPU utilization in percentage, sum of User + Sys + Nice + Wait. Weights based on remaining cpu capacity; 1 - utilization
* ``mix`` / ``MixMetricsSelector`` - Combines heap, cpu and load. Weights based on mean of remaining capacity of the combined selectors.
* Any custom implementation of ``akka.cluster.routing.MetricsSelector``

The collected metrics values are smoothed with `exponential weighted moving average <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average>`_. In the :ref:`cluster_configuration_scala` you can adjust how quickly past data is decayed compared to new data.

Let's take a look at this router in action.

In this example the following imports are used:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/factorial/FactorialSample.scala#imports

The backend worker that performs the factorial calculation:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/factorial/FactorialSample.scala#backend

The frontend that receives user jobs and delegates to the backends via the router:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/factorial/FactorialSample.scala#frontend


As you can see, the router is defined in the same way as other routers, and in this case it's configured as follows:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/resources/application.conf#adaptive-router

It's only router type ``adaptive`` and the ``metrics-selector`` that is specific to this router, other things work 
in the same way as other routers.

The same type of router could also have been defined in code:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/factorial/FactorialSample.scala#router-lookup-in-code

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/factorial/FactorialSample.scala#router-deploy-in-code

This example is included in ``akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster``
and you can try by starting nodes in different terminal windows. For example, starting 3 backend nodes and one frontend::

  sbt

  project akka-sample-cluster-experimental

  run-main sample.cluster.factorial.FactorialBackend 2551

  run-main sample.cluster.factorial.FactorialBackend 2552

  run-main sample.cluster.factorial.FactorialBackend

  run-main sample.cluster.factorial.FactorialFrontend

Press ctrl-c in the terminal window of the frontend to stop the factorial calculations.

Subscribe to Metrics Events
---------------------------

It's possible to subscribe to the metrics events directly to implement other functionality.

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/main/scala/sample/cluster/factorial/FactorialSample.scala#metrics-listener

Custom Metrics Collector
------------------------

You can plug-in your own metrics collector instead of 
``akka.cluster.SigarMetricsCollector`` or ``akka.cluster.JmxMetricsCollector``. Look at those two implementations
for inspiration. The implementation class can be defined in the :ref:`cluster_configuration_scala`.

How to Test
^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`multi-node-testing` is useful for testing cluster applications.

Set up your project according to the instructions in :ref:`multi-node-testing` and :ref:`multi-jvm-testing`, i.e.
add the ``sbt-multi-jvm`` plugin and the dependency to ``akka-remote-tests-experimental``.

First, as described in :ref:`multi-node-testing`, we need some scaffolding to configure the ``MultiNodeSpec``.
Define the participating roles and their :ref:`cluster_configuration_scala` in an object extending ``MultiNodeConfig``:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSpec.scala
   :include: MultiNodeConfig
   :exclude: router-lookup-config

Define one concrete test class for each role/node. These will be instantiated on the different nodes (JVMs). They can be
implemented differently, but often they are the same and extend an abstract test class, as illustrated here.

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSpec.scala#concrete-tests

Note the naming convention of these classes. The name of the classes must end with ``MultiJvmNode1``, ``MultiJvmNode2``
and so on. It's possible to define another suffix to be used by the ``sbt-multi-jvm``, but the default should be
fine in most cases.

Then the abstract ``MultiNodeSpec``, which takes the ``MultiNodeConfig`` as constructor parameter.

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSpec.scala#abstract-test

Most of this can of course be extracted to a separate trait to avoid repeating this in all your tests.

Typically you begin your test by starting up the cluster and let the members join, and create some actors.
That can be done like this:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSpec.scala#startup-cluster

From the test you interact with the cluster using the ``Cluster`` extension, e.g. ``join``.

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSpec.scala#join

Notice how the `testActor` from :ref:`testkit <akka-testkit>` is added as :ref:`subscriber <cluster_subscriber_scala>`
to cluster changes and then waiting for certain events, such as in this case all members becoming 'Up'.

The above code was running for all roles (JVMs). ``runOn`` is a convenient utility to declare that a certain block
of code should only run for a specific role.

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSpec.scala#test-statsService

Once again we take advantage of the facilities in :ref:`testkit <akka-testkit>` to verify expected behavior.
Here using ``testActor`` as sender (via ``ImplicitSender``) and verifing the reply with ``expectMsgPF``.

In the above code you can see ``node(third)``, which is useful facility to get the root actor reference of
the actor system for a specific role. This can also be used to grab the ``akka.actor.Address`` of that node.

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-samples/akka-sample-cluster/src/multi-jvm/scala/sample/cluster/stats/StatsSampleSpec.scala#addresses


.. _cluster_jmx_scala:

JMX
^^^

Information and management of the cluster is available as JMX MBeans with the root name ``akka.Cluster``.
The JMX information can be displayed with an ordinary JMX console such as JConsole or JVisualVM.

From JMX you can:

* see what members that are part of the cluster
* see status of this node
* join this node to another node in cluster
* mark any node in the cluster as down
* tell any node in the cluster to leave

Member nodes are identified with their address, in format `akka://actor-system-name@hostname:port`.

.. _cluster_command_line_scala:

Command Line Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The cluster can be managed with the script `bin/akka-cluster` provided in the
Akka distribution.

Run it without parameters to see instructions about how to use the script::

  Usage: bin/akka-cluster <node-hostname:jmx-port> <command> ...

  Supported commands are:
             join <node-url> - Sends request a JOIN node with the specified URL
            leave <node-url> - Sends a request for node with URL to LEAVE the cluster
             down <node-url> - Sends a request for marking node with URL as DOWN
               member-status - Asks the member node for its current status
              cluster-status - Asks the cluster for its current status (member ring,
                               unavailable nodes, meta data etc.)
                      leader - Asks the cluster who the current leader is
                is-singleton - Checks if the cluster is a singleton cluster (single
                               node cluster)
                is-available - Checks if the member node is available
                  is-running - Checks if the member node is running
             has-convergence - Checks if there is a cluster convergence
  Where the <node-url> should be on the format of 
    'akka://actor-system-name@hostname:port'

  Examples: bin/akka-cluster localhost:9999 is-available
            bin/akka-cluster localhost:9999 join akka://MySystem@darkstar:2552
            bin/akka-cluster localhost:9999 cluster-status


To be able to use the script you must enable remote monitoring and management when starting the JVMs of the cluster nodes,
as described in `Monitoring and Management Using JMX Technology <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html>`_

Example of system properties to enable remote monitoring and management::

  java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999 \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false

.. _cluster_configuration_scala:

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several configuration properties for the cluster. We refer to the following
reference file for more information:


.. literalinclude:: ../../../akka-cluster/src/main/resources/reference.conf
   :language: none

Cluster Scheduler
-----------------

It is recommended that you change the ``tick-duration`` to 33 ms or less
of the default scheduler when using cluster, if you don't need to have it
configured to a longer duration for other reasons. If you don't do this
a dedicated scheduler will be used for periodic tasks of the cluster, which
introduce the extra overhead of another thread.

::

  # shorter tick-duration of default scheduler when using cluster
  akka.scheduler.tick-duration.tick-duration = 33ms

 Migration Guide 2.3.x to 2.4.x
################################

The 2.4 release contains some structural changes that require some
simple, mechanical source-level changes in client code.

When migrating from earlier versions you should first follow the instructions for
migrating :ref:`1.3.x to 2.0.x <migration-2.0>` and then :ref:`2.0.x to 2.1.x <migration-2.1>`
and then :ref:`2.1.x to 2.2.x <migration-2.2>` and then :ref:`2.2.x to 2.3.x <migration-2.3>`.

Advanced Notice: TypedActors will go away
========================================

While technically not yet deprecated, the current ``akka.actor.TypedActor`` support will be superseded by
the Akka Typed project that is currently being developed in open preview mode. If you are using TypedActors
in your projects you are advised to look into this, as it is superior to the Active Object pattern expressed
in TypedActors. The generic ActorRefs in Akka Typed allow the same type-safety that is afforded by
TypedActors while retaining all the other benefits of an explicit actor model (including the ability to
change behaviors etc.).

It is likely that TypedActors will be officially deprecated in the next major update of Akka and subsequently removed.

TestKit.remaining throws AssertionError
=======================================

In earlier versions of Akka `TestKit.remaining` returned the default timeout configurable under
"akka.test.single-expect-default". This was a bit confusing and thus it has been changed to throw an
AssertionError if called outside of within. The old behavior however can still be achieved by
calling `TestKit.remainingOrDefault` instead.

EventStream and ActorClassification EventBus now require an ActorSystem
=======================================================================

Both the ``EventStream`` (:ref:`Scala <event-stream-scala>`, :ref:`Java <event-stream-java>`) and the
``ActorClassification`` Event Bus (:ref:`Scala <actor-classification-scala>`, :ref:`Java <actor-classification-java>`) now
require an ``ActorSystem`` to properly operate. The reason for that is moving away from stateful internal lifecycle checks
to a fully reactive model for unsubscribing actors that have ``Terminated``.

If you have implemented a custom event bus, you will need to pass in the actor system through the constructor now:

.. includecode:: ../scala/code/docs/event/EventBusDocSpec.scala#actor-bus

If you have been creating EventStreams manually, you now have to provide an actor system and *start the unsubscriber*:

.. includecode:: ../../../akka-actor-tests/src/test/scala/akka/event/EventStreamSpec.scala#event-bus-start-unsubscriber-scala

Please note that this change affects you only if you have implemented your own busses, Akka's own ``context.eventStream``
is still there and does not require any attention from you concerning this change.

FSM notifies on same state transitions
======================================
When changing states in an Finite-State-Machine Actor (``FSM``), state transition events are emitted and can be handled by the user
either by registering ``onTransition`` handlers or by subscribing to these events by sending it an ``SubscribeTransitionCallBack`` message.

Previously in ``2.3.x`` when an ``FSM`` was in state ``A`` and performed an ``goto(A)`` transition, no state transition notification would be sent.
This is because it would effectively stay in the same state, and was deemed to be semantically equivalent to calling ``stay()``.

In ``2.4.x`` when an ``FSM`` performs a any ``goto(X)`` transition, it will always trigger state transition events.
Which turns out to be useful in many systems where same-state transitions actually should have an effect.

In case you do *not* want to trigger a state transition event when effectively performing an ``X->X`` transition, use ``stay()`` instead.

More control over Channel properties in Akka-IO
===============================================
Method signatures for ``SocketOption`` have been changed to take a channel instead of a socket. The channel's socket
can be retrieved by calling ``channel.socket``. This allows for accessing new NIO features in Java 7.

========================================  =====================================
                 2.3                                      2.4
========================================  =====================================
``beforeDatagramBind(DatagramSocket)``    ``beforeBind(DatagramChannel)``
``beforeServerSocketBind(ServerSocket)``  ``beforeBind(ServerSocketChannel)``
``beforeConnect(Socket)``                 ``beforeBind(SocketChannel)``
\                                         ``afterConnect(DatagramChannel)``
\                                         ``afterConnect(ServerSocketChannel)``
``afterConnect(Socket)``                  ``afterConnect(SocketChannel)``
========================================  =====================================

A new class ``DatagramChannelCreator`` which extends ``SocketOption`` has been added. ``DatagramChannelCreator`` can be used for
custom ``DatagramChannel`` creation logic. This allows for opening IPv6 multicast datagram channels.

Cluster Sharding Entry Path Change
==================================
Previously in ``2.3.x`` entries were direct children of the local ``ShardRegion``. In examples the ``persistenceId`` of entries
included ``self.path.parent.name`` to include the cluster type name.

In ``2.4.x`` entries are now children of a ``Shard``, which in turn is a child of the local ``ShardRegion``. To include the shard
type in the ``persistenceId`` it is now accessed by ``self.path.parent.parent.name`` from each entry.


Circuit Breaker Timeout Change
==============================
In ``2.3.x`` calls protected by the ``CircuitBreaker`` were allowed to run indefinitely and the check to see if the timeout had been exceeded was done after the call had returned.

In ``2.4.x`` the failureCount of the Breaker will be increased as soon as the timeout is reached and a ``Failure[TimeoutException]`` will be returned immediately for asynchronous calls. Synchronous calls will now throw a ``TimeoutException`` after the call is finished.


Removed Deprecated Features
===========================

The following, previously deprecated, features have been removed:

* akka-dataflow

* akka-transactor

* durable mailboxes (akka-mailboxes-common, akka-file-mailbox)

* Cluster.publishCurrentClusterState

* akka.cluster.auto-down, replaced by akka.cluster.auto-down-unreachable-after in Akka 2.3

* Old routers and configuration.

  Note that in router configuration you must now specify if it is a ``pool`` or a ``group``
  in the way that was introduced in Akka 2.3.

* Timeout constructor without unit

* JavaLoggingEventHandler, replaced by JavaLogger

* UntypedActorFactory

* Java API TestKit.dilated, moved to JavaTestKit.dilated

Slf4j logging filter
====================

If you use ``Slf4jLogger`` you should add the following configuration::

    akka.logging-filter = "akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLoggingFilter"

It will filter the log events using the backend configuration (e.g. logback.xml) before
they are published to the event bus.

Pool routers nrOfInstances method now takes ActorSystem
=======================================================

In order to make cluster routers smarter about when they can start local routees,
``nrOfInstances`` defined on ``Pool`` now takes ``ActorSystem`` as an argument.
In case you have implemented a custom Pool you will have to update the method's signature,
however the implementation can remain the same if you don't need to rely on an ActorSystem in your logic.

Logger names use full class name 
================================
Previously, few places in akka used "simple" logger names, such as ``Cluster`` or ``Remoting``.
Now they use full class names, such as ``akka.cluster.Cluster`` or ``akka.remote.Remoting``,
in order to allow package level log level definitions and ease source code lookup. 
In case you used specific "simple" logger name based rules in your ``logback.xml`` configurations,
please change them to reflect appropriate package name, such as
``<logger name='akka.cluster' level='warn' />`` or ``<logger name='akka.remote' level='error' />``

Default interval for TestKit.awaitAssert changed to 100 ms
==========================================================

Default check interval changed from 800 ms to 100 ms. You can define the interval explicitly if you need a
longer interval.

persistenceId
=============

It is now mandatory to define the ``persistenceId`` in subclasses of ``PersistentActor``, ``UntypedPersistentActor``
and ``AbstractPersistentId``.

The rationale behind this change being stricter de-coupling of your Actor hierarchy and the logical
"which persistent entity this actor represents".

In case you want to perserve the old behavior of providing the actor's path as the default ``persistenceId``, you can easily
implement it yourself either as a helper trait or simply by overriding ``persistenceId`` as follows::

    override def persistenceId = self.path.toStringWithoutAddress

Secure Cookies
==============

`Secure cookies` feature was deprecated.

New Cluster Metrics Extension 
=============================
Previously, cluster metrics functionality was located in the ``akka-cluster`` jar.
Now it is split out and moved into a separate akka module: ``akka-cluster-metrics`` jar.
The module comes with few enhancements, such as use of Kamon sigar-loader 
for native library provisioning as well as use of statistical averaging of metrics data.
Note that both old and new metrics configuration entries in the ``reference.conf`` 
are still in the same name space ``akka.cluster.metrics`` but are not compatible.
Make sure to disable legacy metrics in akka-cluster: ``akka.cluster.metrics.enabled=off``,
since it is still enabled in akka-cluster by default (for compatibility with past releases).
Router configuration entries have also changed for the module, they use prefix ``cluster-metrics-``:
``cluster-metrics-adaptive-pool`` and ``cluster-metrics-adaptive-group``
Metrics extension classes and objects are located in the new package ``akka.cluster.metrics``. 
Please see :ref:`Scala <cluster-metrics-scala>`, :ref:`Java <cluster-metrics-java>` for more information.

Overview of built-in stages and their semantics
###############################################

All stages by default backpressure if the computation they encapsulate is not fast enough to keep up with the rate of
incoming elements from the preceding stage. There are differences though how the different stages handle when some of
their downstream stages backpressure them. This table provides a summary of all built-in stages and their semantics.

All stages stop and propagate the failure downstream as soon as any of their upstreams emit a failure unless supervision
is used. This happens to ensure reliable teardown of streams and cleanup when failures happen. Failures are meant to
be to model unrecoverable conditions, therefore they are always eagerly propagated.
For in-band error handling of normal errors (dropping elements if a map fails for example) you should use the
supervision support, or explicitly wrap your element types in a proper container that can express error or success
states (for example ``Try`` in Scala).

Custom components are not covered by this table since their semantics are defined by the user.

Simple processing stages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These stages are all expressible as a ``PushPullStage``. These stages can transform the rate of incoming elements
since there are stages that emit multiple elements for a single input (e.g. `mapConcat') or consume
multiple elements before emitting one output (e.g. ``filter``). However, these rate transformations are data-driven, i.e. it is
the incoming elements that define how the rate is affected. This is in contrast with :ref:`detached-stages-overview`
which can change their processing behavior depending on being backpressured by downstream or not.

Asynchronous processing stages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These stages encapsulate an asynchronous computation, properly handling backpressure while taking care of the asynchronous
operation at the same time (usually handling the completion of a Future).

Nesting and flattening stages

These stages either take a stream and turn it into a stream of streams (nesting) or they take a stream that contains
nested streams and turn them into a stream of elements instead (flattening).

Fan-in stages

Most of these stages can be expressible as a ``GraphStage``. These stages take multiple streams as their input and provide
a single output combining the elements from all of the inputs in different ways.

(*) This behavior is changeable to completing when any upstream completes by setting ``eagerComplete=true``.

Fan-out stages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of these stages can be expressible as a ``GraphStage``. These have one input and multiple outputs. They might
route the elements between different outputs, or emit elements on multiple outputs at the same time.

**The custom fan-out stages that can be built currently are limited**

.. [1] If a Future fails, the stream also fails (unless a different supervision strategy is applied)
.. [2] Except if the encapsulated computation is not fast enough
.. [3] Until the end of stream it is not possible to know whether new substreams will be needed or not

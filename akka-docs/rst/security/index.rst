Security Announcements
======================

Receiving Security Advisories
-----------------------------

The best way to receive any and all security announcements is to subscribe to the `Akka security list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/akka-security>`_.

The mailing list is very low traffic, and receives notifications only after security reports have been managed by the core team and fixes are publicly available.

Reporting Vulnerabilities
-------------------------

We strongly encourage people to report such problems to our private security mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Following best-practice, we strongly encourage anyone to report potential security 
vulnerabilities to security@akka.io before disclosing them in a public forum like the mailing list or as a Github issue.

Reports to this email address will be handled by our security team, who will work together with you
to ensure that a fix can be provided without delay.

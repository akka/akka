Overview of built-in stages and their semantics
===============================================


Source stages
-------------
These built-in sources are available from ``akka.stream.javadsl.Source``:



fromIterator
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Stream the values from an ``Iterator``, requesting the next value when there is demand. The iterator will be created anew on
each materialization of the source which is the reason the factory takes a ``Creator`` rather than an ``Iterator`` directly.

If the iterator perform blocking operations, make sure to run it on a separate dispatcher.

**emits** the next value returned from the iterator

**completes** when the iterator reaches its end

from
^^^^
Stream the values of an ``Iterable``. Make sure the ``Iterable`` is immutable or at least not modified after being used
as a source.

**emits** the next value of the iterable

**completes** after the last element of the iterable has been emitted


single
^^^^^^
Stream a single object

**emits** the value once

**completes** when the single value has been emitted

repeat
^^^^^^
Stream a single object repeatedly

**emits** the same value repeatedly when there is demand

**completes** never

tick
^^^^
A periodical repetition of an arbitrary object. Delay of first tick is specified
separately from interval of the following ticks.

**emits** periodically, if there is downstream backpressure ticks are skipped

**completes** never

fromCompletionStage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Send the single value of the ``CompletionStage`` when it completes and there is demand.
If the ``CompletionStage`` fails the stream is failed with that exception.

**emits** when the ``CompletionStage`` completes

**completes** after the ``CompletionStage`` has completed or when it fails


fromFuture
^^^^^^^^^^
Send the single value of the Scala ``Future`` when it completes and there is demand.
If the future fails the stream is failed with that exception.

**emits** the future completes

**completes** after the future has completed

unfold
^^^^^^
Stream the result of a function as long as it returns a ``Optional``, the value inside the optional
consists of a pair where the first value is a state passed back into the next call to the function allowing
to pass a state. The first invocation of the provided fold function will receive the ``zero`` state.

Can be used to implement many stateful sources without having to touch the more low level ``GraphStage`` API.

**emits** when there is demand and the unfold function over the previous state returns non empty value

**completes** when the unfold function returns an empty value

unfoldAsync
^^^^^^^^^^^
Just like ``unfold`` but the fold function returns a ``CompletionStage`` which will cause the source to
complete or emit when it completes.

Can be used to implement many stateful sources without having to touch the more low level ``GraphStage`` API.

**emits** when there is demand and unfold state returned CompletionStage completes with some value

**completes** when the CompletionStage returned by the unfold function completes with an empty value

empty
^^^^^
Complete right away without ever emitting any elements. Useful when you have to provide a source to
an API but there are no elements to emit.

**emits** never

**completes** directly

maybe
^^^^^
Materialize a ``CompletionStage`` that can be completed with an ``Optional``.
If it is completed with a value it will be eimitted from the source if it is an empty ``Optional`` it will
complete directly.

**emits** when the returned promise is completed with some value

**completes** after emitting some value, or directly if the promise is completed with no value

failed
^^^^^^
Fail directly with a user specified exception.

**emits** never

**completes** fails the stream directly with the given exception

actorPublisher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Wrap an actor extending ``ActorPublisher`` as a source.

**emits** depends on the actor implementation

**completes** when the actor stops

actorRef
^^^^^^^^
Materialize an ``ActorRef``, sending messages to it will emit them on the stream. The actor contain
a buffer but since communication is one way, there is no back pressure. Handling overflow is done by either dropping
elements or failing the stream, the strategy is chosen by the user.

**emits** when there is demand and there are messages in the buffer or a message is sent to the actorref

**completes** when the ``ActorRef`` is sent ``akka.actor.Status.Success`` or ``PoisonPill``

combine
^^^^^^^
Combine several sources, using a given strategy such as merge or concat, into one source.

**emits** when there is demand, but depending on the strategy

**completes** when all sources has completed


range
^^^^^
Emit each integer in a range, with an option to take bigger steps than 1.

**emits** when there is demand, the next value

**completes** when the end of the range has been reached

queue
^^^^^
Materialize a ``SourceQueue`` onto which elements can be pushed for emitting from the source. The queue contains
a buffer, if elements are pushed onto the queue faster than the source is consumed the overflow will be handled with
a strategy specified by the user. Functionality for tracking when an element has been emitted is available through
``SourceQueue.offer``.

**emits** when there is demand and the queue contains elements

**completes** when downstream completes

asSubscriber
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Integration with Reactive Streams, materializes into a ``org.reactivestreams.Subscriber``.


fromPublisher
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Integration with Reactive Streams, subscribes to a ``org.reactivestreams.Publisher``.




Sink stages
-----------
These built-in sinks are available from ``akka.stream.javadsl.Sink``:


head
^^^^
Materializes into a ``CompletionStage`` which completes with the first value arriving,
after this the stream is canceled. If no element is emitted, the CompletionStage is be failed.

**cancels** after receiving one element

**backpressures** never

headOption
^^^^^^^^^^
Materializes into a ``CompletionStage<Optional<T>>`` which completes with the first value arriving wrapped in optional,
or an empty optional if the stream completes without any elements emitted.

**cancels** after receiving one element

**backpressures** never

last
^^^^
Materializes into a ``CompletionStage`` which will complete with the last value emitted when the stream
completes. If the stream completes with no elements the CompletionStage is failed.

**cancels** never

**backpressures** never

lastOption
^^^^^^^^^^
Materialize a ``CompletionStage<Optional<T>>`` which completes with the last value
emitted wrapped in an optional when the stream completes. if the stream completes with no elements the ``CompletionStage`` is
completed with an empty optional.

**cancels** never

**backpressures** never

ignore
^^^^^^
Consume all elements but discards them. Useful when a stream has to be consumed but there is no use to actually
do anything with the elements.

**cancels** never

**backpressures** never

cancelled
^^^^^^^^^
Immediately cancel the stream

**cancels** immediately

seq
^^^
Collect values emitted from the stream into a collection, the collection is available through a ``CompletionStage`` or
which completes when the stream completes. Note that the collection is bounded to ``Integer.MAX_VALUE``,
if more element are emitted the sink will cancel the stream

**cancels** If too many values are collected

foreach
^^^^^^^
Invoke a given procedure for each element received. Note that it is not safe to mutate shared state from the procedure.

The sink materializes into a ``CompletionStage<Optional<Done>>`` which completes when the
stream completes, or fails if the stream fails.

Note that it is not safe to mutate state from the procedure.

**cancels** never

**backpressures** when the previous procedure invocation has not yet completed


foreachParallel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Like ``foreach`` but allows up to ``parallellism`` procedure calls to happen in parallel.

**cancels** never

**backpressures** when the previous parallel procedure invocations has not yet completed


onComplete
^^^^^^^^^^
Invoke a callback when the stream has completed or failed.

**cancels** never

**backpressures** never


fold
^^^^
Fold over emitted element with a function, where each invocation will get the new element and the result from the
previous fold invocation. The first invocation will be provided the ``zero`` value.

Materializes into a CompletionStage that will complete with the last state when the stream has completed.

This stage allows combining values into a result without a global mutable state by instead passing the state along
between invocations.

**cancels** never

**backpressures** when the previous fold function invocation has not yet completed

reduce
^^^^^^
Apply a reduction function on the incoming elements and pass the result to the next invocation. The first invocation
receives the two first elements of the flow.

Materializes into a CompletionStage that will be completed by the last result of the reduction function.

**cancels** never

**backpressures** when the previous reduction function invocation has not yet completed


combine
^^^^^^^
Combine several sinks into one using a user specified strategy

**cancels** depends on the strategy

**backpressures** depends on the strategy


actorRef
^^^^^^^^
Send the elements from the stream to an ``ActorRef``. No backpressure so care must be taken to not overflow the inbox.

**cancels** when the actor terminates

**backpressures** never


actorRefWithAck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Send the elements from the stream to an ``ActorRef`` which must then acknowledge reception after completing a message,
to provide back pressure onto the sink.

**cancels** when the actor terminates

**backpressures** when the actor acknowledgement has not arrived


actorSubscriber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create an actor from a ``Props`` upon materialization, where the actor implements ``ActorSubscriber``, which will
receive the elements from the stream.

Materializes into an ``ActorRef`` to the created actor.

**cancels** when the actor terminates

**backpressures** depends on the actor implementation


asPublisher
^^^^^^^^^^^
Integration with Reactive Streams, materializes into a ``org.reactivestreams.Publisher``.


fromSubscriber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Integration with Reactive Streams, wraps a ``org.reactivestreams.Subscriber`` as a sink




Additional Sink and Source converters
-------------------------------------
Sources and sinks for integrating with ``java.io.InputStream`` and ``java.io.OutputStream`` can be found on
``StreamConverters``. As they are blocking APIs the implementations of these stages are run on a separate
dispatcher configured through the ``akka.stream.blocking-io-dispatcher``.

fromOutputStream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create a sink that wraps an ``OutputStream``. Takes a function that produces an ``OutputStream``, when the sink is
materialized the function will be called and bytes sent to the sink will be written to the returned ``OutputStream``.

Materializes into a ``CompletionStage`` which will complete with a ``IOResult`` when the stream
completes.

Note that a flow can be materialized multiple times, so the function producing the ``OutputStream`` must be able
to handle multiple invocations.

The ``OutputStream`` will be closed when the stream that flows into the ``Sink`` is completed, and the ``Sink``
will cancel its inflow when the ``OutputStream`` is no longer writable.

asInputStream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create a sink which materializes into an ``InputStream`` that can be read to trigger demand through the sink.
Bytes emitted through the stream will be available for reading through the ``InputStream``

The ``InputStream`` will be ended when the stream flowing into this ``Sink`` completes, and the closing the
``InputStream`` will cancel the inflow of this ``Sink``.

fromInputStream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create a source that wraps an ``InputStream``. Takes a function that produces an ``InputStream``, when the source is
materialized the function will be called and bytes from the ``InputStream`` will be emitted into the stream.

Materializes into a ``CompletionStage`` which will complete with a ``IOResult`` when the stream
completes.

Note that a flow can be materialized multiple times, so the function producing the ``InputStream`` must be able
to handle multiple invocations.

The ``InputStream`` will be closed when the ``Source`` is canceled from its downstream, and reaching the end of the
``InputStream`` will complete the ``Source``.

asOutputStream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create a source that materializes into an ``OutputStream``. When bytes are written to the ``OutputStream`` they
are emitted from the source

The ``OutputStream`` will no longer be writable when the ``Source`` has been canceled from its downstream, and
closing the ``OutputStream`` will complete the ``Source``.

File IO Sinks and Sources
-------------------------
Sources and sinks for reading and writing files can be found on ``FileIO``.

fromFile
^^^^^^^^
Emit the contents of a file, as ``ByteString`` s, materializes into a ``CompletionStage`` which will be completed with
a ``IOResult`` upon reaching the end of the file or if there is a failure.

toFile
^^^^^^
Create a sink which will write incoming ``ByteString`` s to a given file.



Flow stages
-----------

All flows by default backpressure if the computation they encapsulate is not fast enough to keep up with the rate of
incoming elements from the preceding stage. There are differences though how the different stages handle when some of
their downstream stages backpressure them.

Most stages stop and propagate the failure downstream as soon as any of their upstreams emit a failure.
This happens to ensure reliable teardown of streams and cleanup when failures happen. Failures are meant to
be to model unrecoverable conditions, therefore they are always eagerly propagated.
For in-band error handling of normal errors (dropping elements if a map fails for example) you should use the
supervision support, or explicitly wrap your element types in a proper container that can express error or success
states.


Simple processing stages
------------------------

These stages can transform the rate of incoming elements since there are stages that emit multiple elements for a
single input (e.g. `mapConcat') or consume multiple elements before emitting one output (e.g. ``filter``).
However, these rate transformations are data-driven, i.e. it is the incoming elements that define how the
rate is affected. This is in contrast with :ref:`detached-stages-overview_java` which can change their processing behavior
depending on being backpressured by downstream or not.

map
^^^
Transform each element in the stream by calling a mapping function with it and passing the returned value downstream.

**emits** when the mapping function returns an element

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

mapConcat
^^^^^^^^^
Transform each element into zero or more elements that are individually passed downstream.

**emits** when the mapping function returns an element or there are still remaining elements from the previously calculated collection

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures or there are still available elements from the previously calculated collection

**completes** when upstream completes and all remaining elements has been emitted

statefulMapConcat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transform each element into zero or more elements that are individually passed downstream. The difference to ``mapConcat`` is that
the transformation function is created from a factory for every materialization of the flow.

**emits** when the mapping function returns an element or there are still remaining elements from the previously calculated collection

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures or there are still available elements from the previously calculated collection

**completes** when upstream completes and all remaining elements has been emitted

filter
^^^^^^
Filter the incoming elements using a predicate. If the predicate returns true the element is passed downstream, if
it returns false the element is discarded.

**emits** when the given predicate returns true for the element

**backpressures** when the given predicate returns true for the element and downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

collect
^^^^^^^
Apply a partial function to each incoming element, if the partial function is defined for a value the returned
value is passed downstream. Can often replace ``filter`` followed by ``map`` to achieve the same in one single stage.

**emits** when the provided partial function is defined for the element

**backpressures** the partial function is defined for the element and downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

grouped
^^^^^^^
Accumulate incoming events until the specified number of elements have been accumulated and then pass the collection of
elements downstream.

**emits** when the specified number of elements has been accumulated or upstream completed

**backpressures** when a group has been assembled and downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

sliding
^^^^^^^
Provide a sliding window over the incoming stream and pass the windows as groups of elements downstream.

Note: the last window might be smaller than the requested size due to end of stream.

**emits** the specified number of elements has been accumulated or upstream completed

**backpressures** when a group has been assembled and downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes


scan
^^^^
Emit its current value which starts at ``zero`` and then applies the current and next value to the given function
emitting the next current value.

Note that this means that scan emits one element downstream before and upstream elements will not be requested until
the second element is required from downstream.

**emits** when the function scanning the element returns a new element

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

fold
^^^^
Start with current value ``zero`` and then apply the current and next value to the given function, when upstream
complete the current value is emitted downstream.

**emits** when upstream completes

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

drop
^^^^
Drop ``n`` elements and then pass any subsequent element downstream.

**emits** when the specified number of elements has been dropped already

**backpressures** when the specified number of elements has been dropped and downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

take
^^^^
Pass ``n`` incoming elements downstream and then complete

**emits** while the specified number of elements to take has not yet been reached

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when the defined number of elements has been taken or upstream completes


takeWhile
^^^^^^^^^
Pass elements downstream as long as a predicate function return true for the element include the element
when the predicate first return false and then complete.

**emits** while the predicate is true and until the first false result

dropWhile
^^^^^^^^^
Drop elements as long as a predicate function return true for the element

**emits** when the predicate returned false and for all following stream elements

**backpressures** predicate returned false and downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

recover
^^^^^^^
Allow sending of one last element downstream when a failure has happened upstream.

**emits** when the element is available from the upstream or upstream is failed and pf returns an element

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures, not when failure happened

**completes** when upstream completes or upstream failed with exception pf can handle

recoverWith
^^^^^^^^^^^
Allow switching to alternative Source when a failure has happened upstream.

**emits** the element is available from the upstream or upstream is failed and pf returns alternative Source

**backpressures** downstream backpressures, after failure happened it backprssures to alternative Source

**completes** upstream completes or upstream failed with exception pf can handle

detach
^^^^^^
Detach upstream demand from downstream demand without detaching the stream rates.

**emits** when the upstream stage has emitted and there is demand

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

throttle
^^^^^^^^
Limit the throughput to a specific number of elements per time unit, or a specific total cost per time unit, where
a function has to be provided to calculate the individual cost of each element.

**emits** when upstream emits an element and configured time per each element elapsed

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes



Asynchronous processing stages
------------------------------

These stages encapsulate an asynchronous computation, properly handling backpressure while taking care of the asynchronous
operation at the same time (usually handling the completion of a CompletionStage).


mapAsync
^^^^^^^^
Pass incoming elements to a function that return a ``CompletionStage`` result. When the CompletionStage arrives the result is passed
downstream. Up to ``n`` elements can be processed concurrently, but regardless of their completion time the incoming
order will be kept when results complete. For use cases where order does not mather ``mapAsyncUnordered`` can be used.

If a ``CompletionStage`` fails, the stream also fails (unless a different supervision strategy is applied)

**emits** when the CompletionStage returned by the provided function finishes for the next element in sequence

**backpressures** when the number of ``CompletionStage`` s reaches the configured parallelism and the downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes and all ``CompletionStage`` s has been completed and all elements has been emitted

mapAsyncUnordered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Like ``mapAsync`` but ``CompletionStage`` results are passed downstream as they arrive regardless of the order of the elements
that triggered them.

If a CompletionStage fails, the stream also fails (unless a different supervision strategy is applied)

**emits** any of the ``CompletionStage`` s returned by the provided function complete

**backpressures** when the number of ``CompletionStage`` s reaches the configured parallelism and the downstream backpressures

**completes** upstream completes and all CompletionStages has been completed  and all elements has been emitted


Timer driven stages
-------------------

These stages process elements using timers, delaying, dropping or grouping elements for certain time durations.

takeWithin
^^^^^^^^^^
Pass elements downstream within a timeout and then complete.

**emits** when an upstream element arrives

**backpressures** downstream backpressures

**completes** upstream completes or timer fires


dropWithin
^^^^^^^^^^
Drop elements until a timeout has fired

**emits** after the timer fired and a new upstream element arrives

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** upstream completes

groupedWithin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Chunk up the stream into groups of elements received within a time window, or limited by the given number of elements,
whichever happens first.

**emits** when the configured time elapses since the last group has been emitted

**backpressures** when the group has been assembled (the duration elapsed) and downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

initialDelay
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Delay the initial element by a user specified duration from stream materialization.

**emits** upstream emits an element if the initial delay already elapsed

**backpressures** downstream backpressures or initial delay not yet elapsed

**completes** when upstream completes


delay
^^^^^
Delay every element passed through with a specific duration.

**emits** there is a pending element in the buffer and configured time for this element elapsed

**backpressures** differs, depends on ``OverflowStrategy`` set

**completes** when upstream completes and buffered elements has been drained


.. _detached-stages-overview_java:

Backpressure aware stages
-------------------------

These stages are aware of the backpressure provided by their downstreams and able to adapt their behavior to that signal.

conflate
^^^^^^^^
Allow for a slower downstream by passing incoming elements and a summary into an aggregate function as long as
there is backpressure. The summary value must be of the same type as the incoming elements, for example the sum or
average of incoming numbers, if aggregation should lead to a different type ``conflateWithSeed`` can be used:

**emits** when downstream stops backpressuring and there is a conflated element available

**backpressures** when the aggregate function cannot keep up with incoming elements

**completes** when upstream completes

conflateWithSeed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Allow for a slower downstream by passing incoming elements and a summary into an aggregate function as long as there
is backpressure. When backpressure starts or there is no backpressure element is passed into a ``seed`` function to
transform it to the summary type.

**emits** when downstream stops backpressuring and there is a conflated element available

**backpressures** when the aggregate or seed functions cannot keep up with incoming elements

**completes** when upstream completes

batch
^^^^^
Allow for a slower downstream by passing incoming elements and a summary into an aggregate function as long as there
is backpressure and a maximum number of batched elements is not yet reached. When the maximum number is reached and
downstream still backpressures batch will also backpressure.

When backpressure starts or there is no backpressure element is passed into a ``seed`` function to transform it
to the summary type.

Will eagerly pull elements, this behavior may result in a single pending (i.e. buffered) element which cannot be
aggregated to the batched value.

**emits** when downstream stops backpressuring and there is a batched element available

**backpressures** when batched elements reached the max limit of allowed batched elements & downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes and a "possibly pending" element was drained


batchWeighted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Allow for a slower downstream by passing incoming elements and a summary into an aggregate function as long as there
is backpressure and a maximum weight batched elements is not yet reached. The weight of each element is determined by
applying ``costFn``. When the maximum total weight is reached and downstream still backpressures batch will also
backpressure.

Will eagerly pull elements, this behavior may result in a single pending (i.e. buffered) element which cannot be
aggregated to the batched value.

**emits** downstream stops backpressuring and there is a batched element available

**backpressures** batched elements reached the max weight limit of allowed batched elements & downstream backpressures

**completes** upstream completes and a "possibly pending" element was drained

expand
^^^^^^
Allow for a faster downstream by expanding the last incoming element to an ``Iterator``. For example
``Iterator.continually(element)`` to keep repating the last incoming element.

**emits** when downstream stops backpressuring

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

buffer (Backpressure)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Allow for a temporarily faster upstream events by buffering ``size`` elements. When the buffer is full backpressure
is applied.

**emits** when downstream stops backpressuring and there is a pending element in the buffer

**backpressures** when buffer is full

**completes** when upstream completes and buffered elements has been drained

buffer (Drop)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Allow for a temporarily faster upstream events by buffering ``size`` elements. When the buffer is full elements are
dropped according to the specified ``OverflowStrategy``:

* ``dropHead()`` drops the oldest element in the buffer to make space for the new element
* ``dropTail()`` drops the youngest element in the buffer to make space for the new element
* ``dropBuffer()`` drops the entire buffer and buffers the new element
* ``dropNew()`` drops the new element

**emits** when downstream stops backpressuring and there is a pending element in the buffer

**backpressures** never (when dropping cannot keep up with incoming elements)

**completes** upstream completes and buffered elements has been drained

buffer (Fail)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Allow for a temporarily faster upstream events by buffering ``size`` elements. When the buffer is full the stage fails
the flow with a ``BufferOverflowException``.

**emits** when downstream stops backpressuring and there is a pending element in the buffer

**backpressures** never, fails the stream instead of backpressuring when buffer is full

**completes** when upstream completes and buffered elements has been drained


Nesting and flattening stages
-----------------------------

These stages either take a stream and turn it into a stream of streams (nesting) or they take a stream that contains
nested streams and turn them into a stream of elements instead (flattening).

prefixAndTail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Take up to `n` elements from the stream (less than `n` only if the upstream completes before emitting `n` elements)
and returns a pair containing a strict sequence of the taken element and a stream representing the remaining elements.

**emits** when the configured number of prefix elements are available. Emits this prefix, and the rest as a substream

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures or substream backpressures

**completes** when prefix elements has been consumed and substream has been consumed


groupBy
^^^^^^^
Demultiplex the incoming stream into separate output streams.

**emits** an element for which the grouping function returns a group that has not yet been created. Emits the new group
there is an element pending for a group whose substream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes (Until the end of stream it is not possible to know whether new substreams will be needed or not)

splitWhen
^^^^^^^^^
Split off elements into a new substream whenever a predicate function return ``true``.

**emits** an element for which the provided predicate is true, opening and emitting a new substream for subsequent elements

**backpressures** when there is an element pending for the next substream, but the previous is not fully consumed yet, or the substream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes (Until the end of stream it is not possible to know whether new substreams will be needed or not)

splitAfter
^^^^^^^^^^
End the current substream whenever a predicate returns ``true``, starting a new substream for the next element.

**emits** when an element passes through. When the provided predicate is true it emits the element * and opens a new substream for subsequent element

**backpressures** when there is an element pending for the next substream, but the previous is not fully consumed yet, or the substream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes (Until the end of stream it is not possible to know whether new substreams will be needed or not)

flatMapConcat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transform each input element into a ``Source`` whose elements are then flattened into the output stream through
concatenation. This means each source is fully consumed before consumption of the next source starts.

**emits** when the current consumed substream has an element available

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes and all consumed substreams complete


flatMapMerge
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transform each input element into a ``Source`` whose elements are then flattened into the output stream through
merging. The maximum number of merged sources has to be specified.

**emits** when one of the currently consumed substreams has an element available

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes and all consumed substreams complete


Fan-in stages
-------------

These stages take multiple streams as their input and provide a single output combining the elements from all of
the inputs in different ways.

merge
^^^^^
Merge multiple sources. Picks elements randomly if all sources has elements ready.

**emits** when one of the inputs has an element available

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when all upstreams complete (This behavior is changeable to completing when any upstream completes by setting ``eagerComplete=true``.)

mergeSorted
^^^^^^^^^^^
Merge multiple sources. Waits for one element to be ready from each input stream and emits the
smallest element.

**emits** when all of the inputs have an element available

**backpressures** when downstream backpressures

**completes** when all upstreams complete

mergePreferred
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Merge multiple sources. Prefer one source if all sources has elements ready.

source completes the rest of the other stream will be emitted.

**emits** when element is available from the currently consumed upstream

**backpressures** when upstream backpressures

**completes** when both upstreams have completed

Fan-out stages
--------------

These have one input and multiple outputs. They might route the elements between different outputs, or emit elements on
multiple outputs at the same time.

unzip
^^^^^
Takes a stream of two element tuples and unzips the two elements ino two different downstreams.

**emits** when all of the outputs stops backpressuring and there is an input element available

**backpressures** when any of the outputs backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

unzipWith
^^^^^^^^^
Splits each element of input into multiple downstreams using a function

**emits** when all of the outputs stops backpressuring and there is an input element available

**backpressures** when any of the outputs backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

broadcast
^^^^^^^^^
Emit each incoming element each of ``n`` outputs.

**emits** when all of the outputs stops backpressuring and there is an input element available

**backpressures** when any of the outputs backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

balance
^^^^^^^
Fan-out the stream to several streams. Each upstream element is emitted to the first available downstream consumer.

**emits** when any of the outputs stops backpressuring; emits the element to the first available output

**backpressures** when all of the outputs backpressure

**completes** when upstream completes


Watching status stages
----------------------

watchTermination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Materializes to a ``CompletionStage`` that will be completed with Done or failed depending whether the upstream of the stage has been completed or failed.
The stage otherwise passes through elements unchanged.

**emits** when input has an element available

**backpressures** when output backpressures

**completes** when upstream completes

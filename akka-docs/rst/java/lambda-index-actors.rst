Actors (Java with Lambda Support)
=================================

Starting with Akka 2.4.2 we have begun to introduce Java 8 types (most
prominently ``java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage`` and
``java.util.Optional``) where that was possible without breaking binary or
source compatibility. Where this was not possible (for example in the return
type of ``ActorSystem.terminate()``) please refer to the
``scala-java8-compat`` library that allows easy conversion between the Scala
and Java counterparts. The artifact can be included in Maven builds using::

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.scala-lang.modules</groupId>
      <artifactId>scala-java8-compat_2.11</artifactId>
      <version>0.7.0</version>
    </dependency>

We will only be able to seamlessly integrate all functional interfaces once
we can rely on Scala 2.12 to provide full interoperabilityâ€”this will mean that
Scala users can directly implement Java Functional Interfaces using lambda syntax
as well as that Java users can directly implement Scala functions using lambda
syntax.

.. _-delete-java-:

delete
======

Matches requests with HTTP method ``DELETE``.

This directive filters an incoming request by its HTTP method. Only requests with
method ``DELETE`` are passed on to the inner route. All others are rejected with a
``MethodRejection``, which is translated into a ``405 Method Not Allowed`` response
by the default ``RejectionHandler``.

extractMethod
=============

Description
-----------

Extracts the :class:`HttpMethod` from the request context and provides it for use for other directives explicitly.

Example
-------

In the below example our route first matches all ``GET`` requests, and if an incoming request wasn't a ``GET``,
the matching continues and the extractMethod route will be applied which we can use to programatically
print what type of request it was - independent of what actual HttpMethod it was:

Custom Http Method
------------------

When you define a custom HttpMethod, you can define a route using extractMethod.

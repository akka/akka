withLog
=======

Description
-----------

Allows running an inner route using an alternative :class:`LoggingAdapter` in place of the default one.

The logging adapter can be extracted in an inner route using :ref:`-extractLog-java-` directly,
or used by directives which internally extract the materializer without surfacing this fact in the API.

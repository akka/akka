BasicDirectives
===============

Basic directives are building blocks for building :ref:`Custom Directives`. As such they
usually aren't used in a route directly but rather in the definition of new directives.


.. _ProvideDirectives:

Providing Values to Inner Routes
--------------------------------

These directives provide values to the inner routes with extractions. They can be distinguished
on two axes: a) provide a constant value or extract a value from the ``RequestContext`` b) provide
a single value or a tuple of values.

  * :ref:`-extract-`
  * :ref:`-extractExecutionContext-`
  * :ref:`-extractMaterializer-`
  * :ref:`-extractLog-`
  * :ref:`-extractRequest-`
  * :ref:`-extractRequestContext-`
  * :ref:`-extractSettings-`
  * :ref:`-extractUnmatchedPath-`
  * :ref:`-extractUri-`
  * :ref:`-textract-`
  * :ref:`-provide-`
  * :ref:`-tprovide-`


.. _Request Transforming Directives:

Transforming the Request(Context)
---------------------------------

  * :ref:`-mapRequest-`
  * :ref:`-mapRequestContext-`
  * :ref:`-mapSettings-`
  * :ref:`-mapUnmatchedPath-`
  * :ref:`-withExecutionContext-`
  * :ref:`-withMaterializer-`
  * :ref:`-withLog-`
  * :ref:`-withSettings-`


.. _Response Transforming Directives:

Transforming the Response
-------------------------

These directives allow to hook into the response path and transform the complete response or
the parts of a response or the list of rejections:

  * :ref:`-mapResponse-`
  * :ref:`-mapResponseEntity-`
  * :ref:`-mapResponseHeaders-`


.. _Result Transformation Directives:

Transforming the RouteResult
----------------------------

These directives allow to transform the RouteResult of the inner route.

  * :ref:`-cancelRejection-`
  * :ref:`-cancelRejections-`
  * :ref:`-mapRejections-`
  * :ref:`-mapRouteResult-`
  * :ref:`-mapRouteResultFuture-`
  * :ref:`-mapRouteResultPF-`
  * :ref:`-mapRouteResultWith-`
  * :ref:`-mapRouteResultWithPF-`
  * :ref:`-recoverRejections-`
  * :ref:`-recoverRejectionsWith-`


Other
-----

  * :ref:`-mapInnerRoute-`
  * :ref:`-pass-`

recoverRejectionsWith
=====================

Description
-----------

**Low level directive** â€“ unless you're sure you need to be working on this low-level you might instead
want to try the :ref:`-handleRejections-java-` directive which provides a nicer DSL for building rejection handlers.

Transforms rejections from the inner route with a ``Function<Iterable<Rejection>, CompletionStage<RouteResult>>``.

Asynchronous version of :ref:`-recoverRejections-java-`.

See :ref:`-recoverRejections-java-` (the synchronous equivalent of this directive) for a detailed description.

.. note::
  To learn more about how and why rejections work read the :ref:`rejections-java` section of the documentation.

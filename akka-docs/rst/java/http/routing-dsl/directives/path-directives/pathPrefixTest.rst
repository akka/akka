pathPrefixTest
==============

Description
-----------
Checks whether the unmatched path of the ``RequestContext`` has a prefix matched by the given ``PathMatcher``.
Potentially extracts one or more values (depending on the type of the argument) but doesn't consume its match from
the unmatched path.

This directive is very similar to the :ref:`-pathPrefix-java-` directive with the one difference that the path prefix
it matched (if it matched) is *not* consumed. The unmatched path of the ``RequestContext`` is therefore left as
is even in the case that the directive successfully matched and the request is passed on to its inner route.

For more info on how to create a ``PathMatcher`` see :ref:`pathmatcher-dsl`.

As opposed to its :ref:`-rawPathPrefixTest-java-` counterpart ``pathPrefixTest`` automatically adds a leading slash to its
``PathMatcher`` argument, you therefore don't have to start your matching expression with an explicit slash.

Depending on the type of its ``PathMatcher`` argument the ``pathPrefixTest`` directive extracts zero or more values from
the URI. If the match fails the request is rejected with an :ref:`empty rejection set <empty rejections>`.

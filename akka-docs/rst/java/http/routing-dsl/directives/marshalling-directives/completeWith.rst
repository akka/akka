completeWith
============

Description
-----------
Uses the marshaller for a given type to produce a completion function that is passed to its
inner route.  You can use it to decouple marshaller resolution from request completion.

The ``completeWith`` directive works in conjuction with ``instanceOf`` and ``spray.httpx.marshalling``
to convert higher-level (object) structure into some lower-level serialized "wire format".
:ref:`The marshalling documentation <http-marshalling-java>` explains this process in detail.
This directive simplifies exposing types to clients via a route while providing some
form of access to the current context.

``completeWith`` is similar to ``handleWith``.  The main difference is with ``completeWith`` you must eventually call
the completion function generated by ``completeWith``.  ``handleWith`` will automatically call ``complete`` when the
``handleWith`` function returns.

Examples
--------

The following example uses ``spray-json`` to marshall a simple ``Person`` class to a json
response.  It utilizes ``SprayJsonSupport`` via the ``PersonJsonSupport`` object as the in-scope
unmarshaller.

TODO: Add example snippets

The ``findPerson`` takes an argument of type ``Person => Unit`` which is generated by the ``completeWith``
call.  We can handle any logic we want in ``findPerson`` and call our completion function to
complete the request.

Marshalling Directives
======================

Marshalling directives work in conjunction with ``akka.http.scaladsl.marshalling`` and ``akka.http.scaladsl.unmarshalling`` to convert
a request entity to a specific type or a type to a response.

See :ref:`marshalling <http-marshalling-java>` and :ref:`unmarshalling <http-unmarshalling-java>` for specific
serialization (also known as pickling) guidance.

Marshalling directives usually rely on an in-scope implicit marshaller to handle conversion.

:ref:`-completeWith-java-`              Uses a marshaller for a given type to produce a completion function for an inner route. Used in conjuction with *instanceOf* to format responses.
:ref:`-entity-java-`                    Unmarshalls the request entity to the given type and passes it to its inner route.  Used in conjection with *as* to convert requests to objects.
:ref:`-handleWith-java-`                Completes a request with a given function, using an in-scope unmarshaller for an input and in-scope marshaller for the output.

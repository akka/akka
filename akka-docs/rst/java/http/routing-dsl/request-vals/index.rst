Request values
==============

A request value of type ``RequestVal<T>`` is a typed structure that represents some aspect of the request
that can be interpreted as a value of type ``T``. A ``RequestVal`` instance abstracts the knowledge about how
to extract a certain value from the request and interpret it as a ``T``. It is used in combination with
:ref:`handlers-java`.

The advantage of representing a request detail as a ``RequestVal`` instead of performing ad-hoc analysis of
a request are:

 * you can define an "inventory" of HTTP primitives for your application that you can reuse in many places of your
   application
 * automatic handling of errors when an expected value was not found in a request or if it could not be interpreted
   as the expected Java type

Note, that the Scala version of the routing DSL has no direct correspondent to RequestVals. Instead,
a Scala-side ``Directive`` can have "extractions" that are reflected in the type of the ``Directive``.

Predefined Request values
-------------------------

akka-http provides a set of predefined request values for request data commonly accessed in a web
service.

These request values are defined in the following objects:

:ref:`akka.http.javadsl.server.values.FormFields <form-field-request-vals-java>`
  Contains request values for basic data like URI components, request method, peer address, or the entity data.
akka.http.javadsl.server.values.FormFieldsCookies
  Contains request values representing cookies.
akka.http.javadsl.server.values.FormFields
  Contains request values to access form fields unmarshalled to various primitive Java types.
:ref:`akka.http.javadsl.server.values.Headers <header-request-vals-java>`
  Contains request values to access request headers or header values.
akka.http.javadsl.server.values.FormFieldsHttpBasicAuthenticator
  An abstract class to implement to create a request value representing a HTTP basic authenticated principal.
akka.http.javadsl.server.values.FormFieldsParameters
  Contains request values to access URI paramaters unmarshalled to various primitive Java types.
akka.http.javadsl.server.values.FormFieldsPathMatchers
  Contains request values to match and access URI path segments.
akka.http.javadsl.server.values.FormFieldsCustomRequestVal
  An abstract class to implement arbitrary custom request values.
:ref:`akka.http.javadsl.server.values.HttpBasicAuthenticator.scala <http-basic-authenticator-java>`
  An abstract class to implement HTTP basic authentication
:ref:`akka.http.javadsl.server.values.OAuth2Authenticator <oauth2-authenticator-java>`
  An abstract class to implement Oauth 2 bearer token authentication

 * The first thing the actor needs to do, is to subscribe to a channel of events,
 * Then it must replay (process) all "old" events
 * Then it has to wait for a GoAhead signal to begin processing the new events
 * It mustn't "miss" events that happen between catching up with the old events and getting the GoAhead signal

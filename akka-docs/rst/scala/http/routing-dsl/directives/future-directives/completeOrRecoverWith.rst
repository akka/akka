completeOrRecoverWith
=====================

Signature
---------

.. includecode2:: /../../akka-http/src/main/scala/akka/http/scaladsl/server/directives/FutureDirectives.scala
   :snippet: completeOrRecoverWith

Description
-----------
If the ``Future[T]`` succeeds the request is completed using the value's marshaller (this directive therefore
requires a marshaller for the future's parameter type to be implicitly available). The execution of the inner
route passed to this directive is only executed if the given future completed with a failure,
exposing the reason of failure as an extraction of type ``Throwable``.

To handle the successful case manually as well, use the :ref:`-onComplete-` directive, instead.

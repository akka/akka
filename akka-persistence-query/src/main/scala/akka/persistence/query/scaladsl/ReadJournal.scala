/**
 * API for reading persistent events and information derived
 * from stored persistent events.
 *
 * The purpose of the API is not to enforce compatibility between different
 * journal implementations, because the technical capabilities may be very different.
 * The interface is very open so that different journals may implement specific queries.
 *
 * There are a few pre-defined queries that a query implementation may implement,
 * such as [[EventsByPersistenceIdQuery]], [[AllPersistenceIdsQuery]] and [[EventsByTagQuery]]
 * Implementation of these queries are optional and query (journal) plugins may define
 * their own specialized queries by implementing other methods.
 *
 * Usage:
 * {{{
 * val journal = PersistenceQuery(system).readJournalFor[SomeCoolReadJournal](queryPluginConfigPath)
 * val events = journal.query(EventsByTag("mytag", 0L))
 * }}}
 *
 * For Java API see [[akka.persistence.query.javadsl.ReadJournal]].

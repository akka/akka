/**
 * A query plugin must implement a class that implements this trait.
 * It provides the concrete implementations for the Java and Scala APIs.
 *
 * A read journal plugin must provide implementations for both
 * `akka.persistence.query.scaladsl.ReadJournal` and `akka.persistence.query.javadsl.ReadJournal`.
 * The plugin must implement both the `scaladsl` and the `javadsl` traits because the
 * `akka.stream.scaladsl.Source` and `akka.stream.javadsl.Source` are different types
 * and even though those types can easily be converted to each other it is most convenient
 * for the end user to get access to the Java or Scala `Source` directly.
 * One of the implementations can delegate to the other.

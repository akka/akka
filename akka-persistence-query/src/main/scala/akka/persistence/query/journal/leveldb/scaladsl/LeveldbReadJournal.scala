  /**
   * `eventsByTag` is used for retrieving events that were marked with

   *
   * To tag events you create an [[akka.persistence.journal.EventAdapter]] that wraps the events
   * in a [[akka.persistence.journal.Tagged]] with the given `tags`.
   *
   * You can use `NoOffset` to retrieve all events with a given tag or retrieve a subset of all
   * events by specifying a `Sequence` `offset`. The `offset` corresponds to an ordered sequence number for
   * the specific tag. Note that the corresponding offset of each event is provided in the
   * [[akka.persistence.query.EventEnvelope]], which makes it possible to resume the
   * stream at a later point from a given offset.
   *
   * The `offset` is exclusive, i.e. the event with the exact same sequence number will not be included
   * in the returned stream. This means that you can use the offset that is returned in `EventEnvelope`
   * as the `offset` parameter in a subsequent query.
   *
   * In addition to the `offset` the `EventEnvelope` also provides `persistenceId` and `sequenceNr`
   * for each event. The `sequenceNr` is the sequence number for the persistent actor with the
   * `persistenceId` that persisted the event. The `persistenceId` + `sequenceNr` is an unique
   * identifier for the event.
   *
   * The returned event stream is ordered by the offset (tag sequence number), which corresponds
   * to the same order as the write journal stored the events. The same stream elements (in same order)
   * are returned for multiple executions of the query. Deleted events are not deleted from the
   * tagged event stream.
   *
   * The stream is not completed when it reaches the end of the currently stored events,
   * but it continues to push new events when new events are persisted.
   * Corresponding query that is completed when it reaches the end of the currently
   * stored events is provided by [[#currentEventsByTag]].

   * efficiency reasons the query side retrieves the events in batches that sometimes can

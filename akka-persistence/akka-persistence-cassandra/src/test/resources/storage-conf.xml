           The CompareWith attribute tells Cassandra how to sort the columns
           for slicing operations.  For backwards compatibility, the default
           is to use AsciiType, which is probably NOT what you want.
           Other options are BytesType, UTF8Type, LexicalUUIDType, TimeUUIDType, and LongType.
           You can also specify the fully-qualified class name to a class
           of your choice implementing org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.IType.

           SuperColumns have a similar CompareSubcolumnsWith attribute.

           ByteType: simple sort by byte value.  No validation is performed.
           AsciiType: like BytesType, but validates that the input can be parsed as US-ASCII.
           UTF8Type: A string encoded as UTF8
           LongType: A 64bit long
           LexicalUUIDType: a 128bit UUID, compared lexically (by byte value)
           TimeUUIDType: a 128bit version 1 UUID, compared by timestamp

           (To get the closest approximation to 0.3-style supercolumns,

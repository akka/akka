   * Plugin API: asynchronously replays persistent messages. Implementations replay
   * a message by calling `replayCallback`. The returned future must be completed
   * when all messages (matching the sequence number bounds) have been replayed.
   * The future must be completed with a failure if any of the persistent messages
   * could not be replayed.
   *
   * The `replayCallback` must also be called with messages that have been marked
   * as deleted. In this case a replayed message's `deleted` method must return
   * `true`.
   *
   * The `toSequenceNr` is the lowest of what was returned by [[#asyncReadHighestSequenceNr]]
   * and what the user specified as recovery [[akka.persistence.Recovery]] parameter.
   * This does imply that this call is always preceded by reading the highest sequence
   * number for the given `persistenceId`.
   *
   * This call is NOT protected with a circuit-breaker because it may take long time
   * to replay all events. The plugin implementation itself must protect against
   * an unresponsive backend store and make sure that the returned Future is
   * completed with success or failure within reasonable time. It is not allowed
   * to ignore completing the future.
   *
   * @param persistenceId persistent actor id.
   * @param fromSequenceNr sequence number where replay should start (inclusive).
   * @param toSequenceNr sequence number where replay should end (inclusive).
   * @param max maximum number of messages to be replayed.
   * @param recoveryCallback called to replay a single message. Can be called from any
   *                       thread.

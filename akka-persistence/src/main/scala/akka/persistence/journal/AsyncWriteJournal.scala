  //#journal-plugin-api
  /**
   * Plugin API: asynchronously writes a batch (`Seq`) of persistent messages to the
   * journal.
   *
   * The batch is only for performance reasons, i.e. all messages don't have to be written
   * atomically. Higher throughput can typically be achieved by using batch inserts of many
   * records compared to inserting records one-by-one, but this aspect depends on the
   * underlying data store and a journal implementation can implement it as efficient as
   * possible. Journals should aim to persist events in-order for a given `persistenceId`
   * as otherwise in case of a failure, the persistent state may be end up being inconsistent.
   *
   * Each `AtomicWrite` message contains the single `PersistentRepr` that corresponds to
   * the event that was passed to the `persist` method of the `PersistentActor`, or it
   * contains several `PersistentRepr` that corresponds to the events that were passed
   * to the `persistAll` method of the `PersistentActor`. All `PersistentRepr` of the
   * `AtomicWrite` must be written to the data store atomically, i.e. all or none must
   * be stored. If the journal (data store) cannot support atomic writes of multiple
   * events it should reject such writes with a `Try` `Failure` with an
   * `UnsupportedOperationException` describing the issue. This limitation should
   * also be documented by the journal plugin.
   *
   * If there are failures when storing any of the messages in the batch the returned
   * `Future` must be completed with failure. The `Future` must only be completed with
   * success when all messages in the batch have been confirmed to be stored successfully,
   * i.e. they will be readable, and visible, in a subsequent replay. If there is
   * uncertainty about if the messages were stored or not the `Future` must be completed
   * with failure.
   *
   * Data store connection problems must be signaled by completing the `Future` with
   * failure.
   *
   * The journal can also signal that it rejects individual messages (`AtomicWrite`) by
   * the returned `immutable.Seq[Try[Unit]]`. It is possible but not mandatory to reduce
   * number of allocations by returning `Future.successful(Nil)` for the happy path,
   * i.e. when no messages are rejected. Otherwise the returned `Seq` must have as many elements
   * as the input `messages` `Seq`. Each `Try` element signals if the corresponding
   * `AtomicWrite` is rejected or not, with an exception describing the problem. Rejecting
   * a message means it was not stored, i.e. it must not be included in a later replay.
   * Rejecting a message is typically done before attempting to store it, e.g. because of
   * serialization error.
   *
   * Data store connection problems must not be signaled as rejections.
   *
   * It is possible but not mandatory to reduce number of allocations by returning
   * `Future.successful(Nil)` for the happy path, i.e. when no messages are rejected.
   *
   * Calls to this method are serialized by the enclosing journal actor. If you spawn
   * work in asynchronous tasks it is alright that they complete the futures in any order,
   * but the actual writes for a specific persistenceId should be serialized to avoid
   * issues such as events of a later write are visible to consumers (query side, or replay)
   * before the events of an earlier write are visible.
   * A PersistentActor will not send a new WriteMessages request before the previous one
   * has been completed.
   *
   * Please note that the `sender` field of the contained PersistentRepr objects has been
   * nulled out (i.e. set to `ActorRef.noSender`) in order to not use space in the journal
   * for a sender reference that will likely be obsolete during replay.
   *
   * Please also note that requests for the highest sequence number may be made concurrently
   * to this call executing for the same `persistenceId`, in particular it is possible that
   * a restarting actor tries to recover before its outstanding writes have completed. In
   * the latter case it is highly desirable to defer reading the highest sequence number
   * until all outstanding writes have completed, otherwise the PersistentActor may reuse
   * sequence numbers.
   *
   * This call is protected with a circuit-breaker.

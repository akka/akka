/**
 * Mix-in this trait with your `PersistentActor` to send messages with at-least-once
 * delivery semantics to destinations. It takes care of re-sending messages when they
 * have not been confirmed within a configurable timeout. Use the [[AtLeastOnceDeliveryLike#deliver]] method to
 * send a message to a destination. Call the [[AtLeastOnceDeliveryLike#confirmDelivery]] method when the destination
 * has replied with a confirmation message.
 *
 * At-least-once delivery implies that original message send order is not always retained
 * and the destination may receive duplicate messages due to possible resends.
 *
 * The interval between redelivery attempts can be defined by [[AtLeastOnceDeliveryLike#redeliverInterval]].
 * After a number of delivery attempts a [[AtLeastOnceDelivery.UnconfirmedWarning]] message
 * will be sent to `self`. The re-sending will still continue, but you can choose to call
 * [[AtLeastOnceDeliveryLike#confirmDelivery]] to cancel the re-sending.
 *
 * The `AtLeastOnceDelivery` trait has a state consisting of unconfirmed messages and a
 * sequence number. It does not store this state itself. You must persist events corresponding
 * to the `deliver` and `confirmDelivery` invocations from your `PersistentActor` so that the
 * state can be restored by calling the same methods during the recovery phase of the
 * `PersistentActor`. Sometimes these events can be derived from other business level events,
 * and sometimes you must create separate events. During recovery calls to `deliver`
 * will not send out the message, but it will be sent later if no matching `confirmDelivery`
 * was performed.
 *
 * Support for snapshots is provided by [[AtLeastOnceDeliveryLike#getDeliverySnapshot]] and [[AtLeastOnceDeliveryLike#setDeliverySnapshot]].
 * The `AtLeastOnceDeliverySnapshot` contains the full delivery state, including unconfirmed messages.
 * If you need a custom snapshot for other parts of the actor state you must also include the
 * `AtLeastOnceDeliverySnapshot`. It is serialized using protobuf with the ordinary Akka
 * serialization mechanism. It is easiest to include the bytes of the `AtLeastOnceDeliverySnapshot`
 * as a blob in your custom snapshot.

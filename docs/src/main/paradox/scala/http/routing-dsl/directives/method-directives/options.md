## Signature

@@signature [MethodDirectives.scala](../../../../../../../../../akka-http/src/main/scala/akka/http/scaladsl/server/directives/MethodDirectives.scala) { #options }

## Description

Matches requests with HTTP method `OPTIONS`.

This directive filters the incoming request by its HTTP method. Only requests with
method `OPTIONS` are passed on to the inner route. All others are rejected with a
`MethodRejection`, which is translated into a `405 Method Not Allowed` response
by the default @ref[RejectionHandler](../../rejections.md#the-rejectionhandler).

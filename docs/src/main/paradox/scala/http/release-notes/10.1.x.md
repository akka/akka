# 10.1.x Release Notes

## 10.1.0-RC1

See the [announcement](https://akka.io/blog/news/2017/12/22/akka-http-10.1.0-RC1-released.html) and
closed tickets on the [10.1.0-RC1 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/26?closed=1).

10.1.0-RC1 is the first release candidate for the next minor version of Akka HTTP. The most important changes are

 * Removing support for Akka 2.4.x which is at its end-of-life with the end of 2017. In the future, this will allow us
   to make use of features that only Akka 2.5 supports.
 * Removing methods that have been deprecated during the life-time of Akka HTTP 10.0.x. For now, methods only deprecated
   in the last release of Akka HTTP, 10.0.11, are not yet removed to allow for a smooth transition.
 * The new client pool implementation introduced in 10.0.11 is now the default.
 * Documentation has now almost completely been consolidated between Scala and Java pages. Hundreds of directive
   documentation pages have been merged in a tireless effort by [@jonas](https://github.com/jonas),
   [@jlprat](https://github.com/jlprat), and Akka team's [@raboof](https://github.com/raboof).

### Akka is not an explicit dependency any more / Removal of Akka 2.4 support

Akka HTTP supports Akka 2.5 (and future versions during the life of Akka HTTP 10.1.x). However, using Akka HTTP with Akka 2.5 used to be
a bit confusing, because Akka HTTP explicitly depended on Akka 2.4. Trying to use it together with Akka 2.5,
running an Akka HTTP application could fail with class loading issues if you forgot to add a dependency to
both `akka-actor` *and* `akka-stream` of the same version. For that reason, we changed the policy not to depend on `akka-stream`
explicitly any more but mark it as a `provided` dependency in our build. That means that you will *always* have to add
a manual dependency to `akka-stream`. Please make sure you have chosen and added a dependency to `akka-stream` when
updating to the new version. (Veterans may remember this policy from spray.)

Akka 2.4 is not any more officially supported with Akka HTTP 10.1.x.

### Deprecation Removals

Methods were removed that have been deprecated during the life-time of Akka HTTP 10.0.x. Methods that were only deprecated
in the last release of Akka HTTP, 10.0.11, are not yet removed to allow for a smooth transition. In general, our guarantee
for minor release updates is that code that compiled on the latest version of the previous minor release (10.0.11 in this case)
should be both source and binary compatible with the latest version of the current minor release. We might make
exceptions to the rule for cases where the maintenance burden seems greater than the risk of breaking major users / third-party
libraries. We'll treat any other binary incompatibilities as regressions.

### New client pool implementation is now the default

The new client pool implementation introduced in 10.0.11 is now the default. In this release we fixed several bugs in the
new client pool implementation and we want to foster its adoption. If you encounter problems with the client pool please file
a bug report. You can still fall back to the old implementation by setting `akka.http.host-connection-pool.pool-implementation = legacy`.

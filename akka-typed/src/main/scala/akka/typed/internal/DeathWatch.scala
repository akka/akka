/*
 * THOUGHTS
 *
 * - an ActorRef is a channel that allows sending messages — in particular it is NOT a sender!
 * - a channel is scoped by the session it is part of
 * - termination means that the session ends because sending further messages is pointless
 * - this means that there is no ordering requirement between Terminated and any other received message

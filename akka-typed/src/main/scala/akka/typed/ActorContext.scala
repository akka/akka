/**
 * An Actor is given by the combination of a [[Behavior]] and a context in
 * which this behavior is executed. As per the Actor Model an Actor can perform
 * the following actions when processing a message:
 *
 *  - send a finite number of messages to other Actors it knows
 *  - create a finite number of Actors
 *  - designate the behavior for the next message
 *
 * In Akka the first capability is accessed by using the `!` or `tell` method
 * on an [[ActorRef]], the second is provided by [[ActorContext#spawn]]
 * and the third is implicit in the signature of [[Behavior]] in that the next
 * behavior is always returned from the message processing logic.
 *
 * An `ActorContext` in addition provides access to the Actor’s own identity (“`self`”),
 * the [[ActorSystem]] it is part of, methods for querying the list of child Actors it
 * created, access to [[Terminated DeathWatch]] and timed message scheduling.

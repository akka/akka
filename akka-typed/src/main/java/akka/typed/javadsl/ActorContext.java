/**
 * An Actor is given by the combination of a {@link akka.typed.Behavior} and a context in which
 * this behavior is executed. As per the Actor Model an Actor can perform the
 * following actions when processing a message:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>send a finite number of messages to other Actors it knows</li>
 * <li>create a finite number of Actors</li>
 * <li>designate the behavior for the next message</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In Akka the first capability is accessed by using the {@link akka.typed.ActorRef#tell}
 * method, the second is provided by {@link akka.typed.ActorContext#spawn} and the
 * third is implicit in the signature of {@link akka.typed.Behavior} in that the next behavior
 * is always returned from the message processing logic.
 *
 * An <code>ActorContext</code> in addition provides access to the Actor’s own identity
 * ({@link #getSelf “self”}), the {@link akka.typed.ActorSystem} it is part of, methods for querying the list
 * of child Actors it created, access to {@link akka.typed.Terminated DeathWatch} and timed
 * message scheduling.

/**
 * Implements a 'Observed Remove Set' CRDT, also called a 'OR-Set'.
 * Elements can be added and removed any number of times. Concurrent add wins
 * over remove.
 *
 * It is not implemented as in the paper. This is more space efficient
 * and don't accumulate garbage for removed elements. It is inspired by the
 * <a href="https://github.com/basho/riak_dt/blob/develop/src/riak_dt_orswot.erl">
 * riak_dt_orswot</a>.
 *
 * The ORSet has a version vector that is incremented when an element is added to
 * the set. The `node -> count` pair for that increment is stored against the
 * element as its "birth dot". Every time the element is re-added to the set,
 * its "birth dot" is updated to that of the `node -> count` version vector entry
 * resulting from the add. When an element is removed, we simply drop it, no tombstones.
 *
 * When an element exists in replica A and not replica B, is it because A added
 * it and B has not yet seen that, or that B removed it and A has not yet seen that?
 * In this implementation we compare the `dot` of the present element to the clock
 * in the Set it is absent from. If the element dot is not "seen" by the Set clock,
 * that means the other set has yet to see this add, and the item is in the merged
 * Set. If the Set clock dominates the dot, that means the other Set has removed this
 * element already, and the item is not in the merged Set.

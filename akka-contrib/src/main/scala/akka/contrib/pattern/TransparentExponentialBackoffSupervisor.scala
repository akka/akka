/**
 * A supervising actor that restarts a child actor with an exponential back off.
 *
 * This explicit supervisor behaves similarly to the normal implicit supervision where
 * if an actor throws an exception, the decider on the supervisor will decide when to
 * `Stop`, `Restart`, `Escalate`, `Resume` the child actor.
 *
 * When the `Restart` directive is specified, the supervisor will delay the restart
 * using an exponential back off strategy (bounded by minBackoff and maxBackoff).
 *
 * This supervisor is intended to be transparent to both the child actor and external actors.
 * Where external actors can send messages to the supervisor as if it was the child and the
 * messages will be forwarded. And when the child is `Terminated`, the supervisor is also
 * `Terminated`.
 * Transparent to the child means that the child does not have to be aware that it is being
 * supervised specifically by the [[TransparentExponentialBackoffSupervisor]]. Just like it does
 * not need to know when it is being supervised by the usual implicit supervisors.
 * The only caveat is that the `ActorRef` of the child is not stable, so any user storing the
 * `sender()` `ActorRef` from the child response may eventually not be able to communicate with
 * the stored `ActorRef`. In general all messages to the child should be directed through the
 * [[TransparentExponentialBackoffSupervisor]].
 *
 * An example of where this supervisor might be used is when you may have an actor that is
 * responsible for continuously polling on a server for some resource that sometimes may be down.
 * Instead of hammering the server continuously when the resource is unavailable, the actor will
 * be restarted with an exponentially increasing back off until the resource is available again.
 *
 * '''***
 * This supervisor should not be used with `Akka Persistence` child actors.
 * `Akka Persistence` actors, currently, shutdown unconditionally on `persistFailure()`s rather
 * than throw an exception on a failure like normal actors.
 * [[akka.pattern.BackoffSupervisor]] should be used instead for cases where the child actor
 * terminates itself as a failure signal instead of the normal behavior of throwing an exception.

/**
 * A ReliableProxy is a means to wrap a remote actor reference in order to
 * obtain certain improved delivery guarantees:
 *
 *  - as long as none of the JVMs crashes and the proxy and its remote-deployed
 *    peer are not forcefully terminated or restarted, no messages will be lost
 *  - messages re-sent due to the first point will not be delivered out-of-order,
 *    message ordering is preserved
 *
 * These guarantees are valid for the communication between the two end-points
 * of the reliable “tunnel”, which usually spans an unreliable network. Delivery
 * from the remote end-point to the target actor is still subject to in-JVM
 * delivery semantics (i.e. not strictly guaranteed due to possible OutOfMemory
 * situations or other VM errors).
 *
 * You can create a reliable connection like this:
 *
 * In Scala:
 *
 * {{{
 * val proxy = context.actorOf(Props(classOf[ReliableProxy], target))
 * }}}
 *
 * In Java:
 *
 * {{{
 * final ActorRef proxy = getContext().actorOf(Props.create(ReliableProxy.class target));
 * }}}
 *
 * '''''Please note:''''' the tunnel is uni-directional, and original sender
 * information is retained, hence replies by the wrapped target reference will
 * go back in the normal “unreliable” way unless also secured by a ReliableProxy
 * from the remote end.
 *
 * ==Message Types==
 *
 * This actor is an [[akka.actor.FSM]], hence it offers the service of
 * transition callbacks to those actors which subscribe using the
 * ``SubscribeTransitionCallBack`` and ``UnsubscribeTransitionCallBack``
 * messages; see [[akka.actor.FSM]] for more documentation. The proxy will
 * transition into [[ReliableProxy.Active]] state when ACKs are outstanding and
 * return to the [[ReliableProxy.Idle]] state when every message send so far
 * has been confirmed by the peer end-point.
 * Any other message type sent to this actor will be delivered via a remote-deployed
 * child actor to the designated target. Message types declared in the companion
 * object are for internal use only and not to be sent from the outside.
 *
 * ==Failure Cases==
 *
 * All failures of either the local or the remote end-point are escalated to the
 * parent of this actor; there are no specific error cases which are predefined.
 *
 * ==Arguments==
 *
 * '''''target''''' is the [[akka.actor.ActorRef]] to which all messages will be
 * forwarded which are sent to this actor. It can be any type of actor reference,
 * but the “remote” tunnel endpoint will be deployed on the node where the target
 * ref points to.
 *
 * '''''retryAfter''''' is the ACK timeout after which all outstanding messages
 * will be resent. There is not limit on the queue size or the number of retries.

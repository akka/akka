/**
 * A throttler that uses a timer to control the message delivery rate.
 *
 * == Throttling ==
 * A <em>throttler</em> is an actor that is defined through a <em>target actor</em> and a <em>rate</em>
 * (of type [[akka.contrib.throttle.Throttler.Rate]]). You set or change the target and rate at any time through the
 * [[akka.contrib.throttle.Throttler.SetTarget]] and [[akka.contrib.throttle.Throttler.SetRate]]
 * messages, respectively. When you send the throttler any other message `msg`, it will
 * put the message `msg` into an internal queue and eventually send all queued messages to the target, at
 * a speed that respects the given rate. If no target is currently defined then the messages will be queued
 * and will be delivered as soon as a target gets set.
 *
 * A throttler understands actor messages of type
 * [[akka.contrib.throttle.Throttler.SetTarget]], [[akka.contrib.throttle.Throttler.SetRate]], in
 * addition to any other messages, which the throttler will consider as messages to be sent to
 * the target.
 *
 * == Transparency ==
 * Notice that the throttler `forward`s messages, i.e., the target will see the original message sender
 * (and not the throttler) as the sender of the message.
 *
 * == Persistence ==
 * Throttlers usually use an internal queue to keep the messages that need to be sent to the target.
 * You therefore cannot rely on the throttler's inbox size in order to learn how much messages are
 * outstanding.
 *
 * It is left to the implementation whether the internal queue is persisted over application restarts or
 * actor failure.
 *
 * == Processing messages ==
 * The target should process messages as fast as possible. If the target requires substantial time to
 * process messages, it should distribute its work to other actors (using for example something like
 * a `BalancingDispatcher`), otherwise the resulting system will always work <em>below</em>
 * the threshold rate.
 *
 * <em>Example:</em> Suppose the throttler has a rate of 3msg/s and the target requires 1s to process a message.
 * This system will only process messages at a rate of 1msg/s: the target will receive messages at at most 3msg/s
 * but as it handles them synchronously and each of them takes 1s, its inbox will grow and grow. In such
 * a situation, the target should <em>distribute</em> its messages to a set of worker actors so that individual messages
 * can be handled in parallel.
 *
 * ==Example==
 * For example, if you set a rate like "3 messages in 1 second", the throttler
 * will send the first three messages immediately to the target actor but will need to impose a delay before
 * sending out further messages:
 * {{{
 *   // A simple actor that prints whatever it receives
 *   class Printer extends Actor {
 *     def receive = {
 *       case x => println(x)
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   val printer = system.actorOf(Props[Printer], "printer")
 *
 *   // The throttler for this example, setting the rate
 *   val throttler = system.actorOf(Props(classOf[TimerBasedThrottler], 3 msgsPer 1.second))
 *
 *   // Set the target
 *   throttler ! SetTarget(Some(printer))
 *   // These three messages will be sent to the printer immediately
 *   throttler ! "1"
 *   throttler ! "2"
 *   throttler ! "3"
 *   // These two will wait at least until 1 second has passed
 *   throttler ! "4"
 *   throttler ! "5"
 * }}}
 *
 * ==Implementation notes==
 * This throttler implementation internally installs a timer that repeats every `rate.durationInMillis` and enables `rate.numberOfCalls`
 * additional calls to take place. A `TimerBasedThrottler` uses very few system resources, provided the rate's duration is not too
 * fine-grained (which would cause a lot of timer invocations); for example, it does not store the calling history
 * as other throttlers may need to do.
 *
 * However, a `TimerBasedThrottler` only provides ''weak guarantees'' on the rate (see also
 * <a href='http://letitcrash.com/post/28901663062/throttling-messages-in-akka-2'>this blog post</a>):
 *
 *  - Only ''delivery'' times are taken into account: if, for example, the throttler is used to throttle
 *    requests to an external web service then only the start times of the web requests are considered.
 *    If a web request takes very long on the server then more than `rate.numberOfCalls`-many requests
 *    may be observed on the server in an interval of duration `rate.durationInMillis()`.
 *  - There may be intervals of duration `rate.durationInMillis()` that contain more than `rate.numberOfCalls`
 *    message deliveries: a `TimerBasedThrottler` only makes guarantees for the intervals
 *    of its ''own'' timer, namely that no more than `rate.numberOfCalls`-many messages are delivered within such intervals. Other intervals on the
 *    timeline may contain more calls.
 *
 * For some applications, these guarantees may not be sufficient.
 *
 * ==Known issues==
 *
 *  - If you change the rate using `SetRate(rate)`, the actual rate may in fact be higher for the
 *    overlapping period (i.e., `durationInMillis()`) of the new and old rate. Therefore,
 *    changing the rate frequently is not recommended with the current implementation.
 *  - The queue of messages to be delivered is not persisted in any way; actor or system failure will
 *    cause the queued messages to be lost.
 *

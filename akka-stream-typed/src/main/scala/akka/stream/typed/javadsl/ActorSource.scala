/**

object ActorSource {

  /**
   * Creates a `Source` that is materialized as an [[akka.actor.typed.ActorRef]].
   * Messages sent to this actor will be emitted to the stream if there is demand from downstream,
   * otherwise they will be buffered until request for demand is received.
   *
   * Depending on the defined [[akka.stream.OverflowStrategy]] it might drop elements if
   * there is no space available in the buffer.
   *
   * The strategy [[akka.stream.OverflowStrategy.backpressure]] is not supported, and an
   * IllegalArgument("Backpressure overflowStrategy not supported") will be thrown if it is passed as argument.
   *
   * The buffer can be disabled by using `bufferSize` of 0 and then received messages are dropped if there is no demand
   * from downstream. When `bufferSize` is 0 the `overflowStrategy` does not matter. An async boundary is added after
   * this Source; as such, it is never safe to assume the downstream will always generate demand.
   *
   * The stream can be completed successfully by sending the actor reference a [[akka.actor.Status.Success]]
   * (whose content will be ignored) in which case already buffered elements will be signaled before signaling
   * completion, or by sending [[akka.actor.PoisonPill]] in which case completion will be signaled immediately.
   *
   * The stream can be completed with failure by sending a [[akka.actor.Status.Failure]] to the
   * actor reference. In case the Actor is still draining its internal buffer (after having received
   * a [[akka.actor.Status.Success]]) before signaling completion and it receives a [[akka.actor.Status.Failure]],
   * the failure will be signaled downstream immediately (instead of the completion signal).
   *
   * The actor will be stopped when the stream is completed, failed or canceled from downstream,
   * i.e. you can watch it to get notified when that happens.
   *
   * See also [[akka.stream.javadsl.Source.queue]].
   *
   * @param bufferSize The size of the buffer in element count
   * @param overflowStrategy Strategy that is used when incoming elements cannot fit inside the buffer

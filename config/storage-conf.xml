         A ColumnFamily is the Cassandra concept closest to a relational table.
         Keyspaces are separate groups of ColumnFamilies.  Except in very
         unusual circumstances you will have one Keyspace per application.

         There is an implicit keyspace named 'system' for Cassandra internals.

         The default ColumnSort is Time for standard column families.
         For super column families, specifying ColumnSort is not supported;
         the supercolumns themselves are always name-sorted and their subcolumns
         are always time-sorted.

                 locations, NOT any column values.)

                 The amount of memory used by the default setting of
                 0.01 is comparable to the amount used by the internal
                 per-sstable key index. Consider increasing this is

                 The CompareWith attribute tells Cassandra how to sort the columns
                 for slicing operations.  For backwards compatibility, the default 
                 is to use AsciiType, which is probably NOT what you want.
                 Other options are BytesType, UTF8Type, LexicalUUIDType, TimeUUIDType, and LongType.
                 You can also specify the fully-qualified class name to a class
                 of your choice implementing org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.IType.

                 SuperColumns have a similar CompareSubcolumnsWith attribute.

                 ByteType: simple sort by byte value.  No validation is performed.
                 AsciiType: like BytesType, but validates that the input can be parsed as US-ASCII.
                 UTF8Type: A string encoded as UTF8
                 LongType: A 64bit long
                 LexicalUUIDType: a 128bit UUID, compared lexically (by byte value)
                 TimeUUIDType: a 128bit version 1 UUID, compared by timestamp

                 (To get the closest approximation to 0.3-style supercolumns,
                 you would use CompareWith=UTF8Type CompareSubcolumnsWith=LongType.)

                 if FlushPeriodInMinutes is configured and positive, it will be
                 flushed to disk with that period whether it is dirty or not.
                 This is intended for lightly-used columnfamilies so that they
                 do not prevent commitlog segments from being purged.

/**
 * This spec measures execution times of the basic operations that an [[akka.persistence.PersistentActor]] provides,
 * using the provided Journal (plugin).
 *
 * It is *NOT* meant to be a comprehensive benchmark, but rather aims to help plugin developers to easily determine
 * if their plugin's performance is roughly as expected. It also validates the plugin still works under "more messages" scenarios.
 *
 * In case your journal plugin needs some kind of setup or teardown, override the `beforeAll` or `afterAll`
 * methods (don't forget to call `super` in your overridden methods).
 *
 * For a Java and JUnit consumable version of the TCK please refer to [[akka.persistence.japi.journal.JavaJournalPerfSpec]].

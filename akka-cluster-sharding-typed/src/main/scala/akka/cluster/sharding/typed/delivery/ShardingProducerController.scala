/**
 * Reliable delivery between a producer actor sending messages to sharded consumer
 * actors receiving the messages.
 *
 * The `ShardingProducerController` should be used together with [[ShardingConsumerController]].
 *
 * A producer can send messages via a `ShardingProducerController` to any `ShardingConsumerController`
 * identified by an `entityId`. A single `ShardingProducerController` per `ActorSystem` (node) can be
 * shared for sending to all entities of a certain entity type. No explicit registration is needed
 * between the `ShardingConsumerController` and `ShardingProducerController`.
 *
 * The producer actor will start the flow by sending a [[ShardingProducerController.Start]]
 * message to the `ShardingProducerController`. The `ActorRef` in the `Start` message is
 * typically constructed as a message adapter to map the [[ShardingProducerController.RequestNext]]
 * to the protocol of the producer actor.
 *
 * The `ShardingProducerController` sends `RequestNext` to the producer, which is then allowed
 * to send one message to the `ShardingProducerController` via the `sendNextTo` in the `RequestNext`.
 * Thereafter the producer will receive a new `RequestNext` when it's allowed to send one more message.
 *
 * In the `RequestNext` message there is information about which entities that have demand. It is allowed
 * to send to a new `entityId` that is not included in the `RequestNext.entitiesWithDemand`. If sending to
 * an entity that doesn't have demand the message will be buffered. This support for buffering means that
 * it is even allowed to send several messages in response to one `RequestNext` but it's recommended to
 * only send one message and wait for next `RequestNext` before sending more messages.
 *
 * The producer and `ShardingProducerController` actors are supposed to be local so that these messages are
 * fast and not lost. This is enforced by a runtime check.
 *
 * There will be one `ShardingConsumerController` for each entity. Many unconfirmed messages can be in
 * flight between the `ShardingProducerController` and each `ShardingConsumerController`. The flow control
 * is driven by the consumer side, which means that the `ShardingProducerController` will not send faster
 * than the demand requested by the consumers.
 *
 * Lost messages are detected, resent and deduplicated if needed. This is also driven by the consumer side,
 * which means that the `ShardingProducerController` will not push resends unless requested by the
 * `ShardingConsumerController`.
 *
 * Until sent messages have been confirmed the `ShardingProducerController` keeps them in memory to be able to
 * resend them. If the JVM of the `ShardingProducerController` crashes those unconfirmed messages are lost.
 * To make sure the messages can be delivered also in that scenario the `ShardingProducerController` can be
 * used with a [[DurableProducerQueue]]. Then the unconfirmed messages are stored in a durable way so
 * that they can be redelivered when the producer is started again. An implementation of the
 * `DurableProducerQueue` is provided by `EventSourcedProducerQueue` in `akka-persistence-typed`.
 *
 * Instead of using `tell` with the `sendNextTo` in the `RequestNext` the producer can use `context.ask`
 * with the `askNextTo` in the `RequestNext`. The difference is that a reply is sent back when the
 * message has been handled. If a `DurableProducerQueue` is used then the reply is sent when the message
 * has been stored successfully, but it might not have been processed by the consumer yet. Otherwise the
 * reply is sent after the consumer has processed and confirmed the message.
 *
 * It's also possible to use the `ShardingProducerController` and `ShardingConsumerController` without resending
 * lost messages, but the flow control is still used. This can be more efficient since messages
 * don't have to be kept in memory in the `ProducerController` until they have been
 * confirmed, but the drawback is that lost messages will not be delivered. See configuration
 * `only-flow-control` of the `ShardingConsumerController`.
 *
 * The `producerId` is used in logging and included as MDC entry with key `"producerId"`. It's propagated
 * to the `ConsumerController` and is useful for correlating log messages. It can be any `String` but it's
 * recommended to use a unique identifier of representing the producer.
 *
 * If the `DurableProducerQueue` is defined it is created as a child actor of the `ShardingProducerController` actor.
 * `ProducerController` actors are created for each destination entity. Those child actors use the same dispatcher
 * as the parent `ShardingProducerController`.

/**
 * This extension provides sharding functionality of actors in a cluster.
 * The typical use case is when you have many stateful actors that together consume
 * more resources (e.g. memory) than fit on one machine. You need to distribute them across
 * several nodes in the cluster and you want to be able to interact with them using their
 * logical identifier, but without having to care about their physical location in the cluster,
 * which might also change over time. It could for example be actors representing Aggregate Roots in
 * Domain-Driven Design terminology. Here we call these actors "entities". These actors
 * typically have persistent (durable) state, but this feature is not limited to
 * actors with persistent state.
 *
 * In this context sharding means that actors with an identifier, so called entities,
 * can be automatically distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster. Each entity
 * actor runs only at one place, and messages can be sent to the entity without requiring
 * the sender to know the location of the destination actor. This is achieved by sending
 * the messages via a `ShardRegion` actor provided by this extension, which knows how
 * to route the message with the entity id to the final destination.
 *
 * This extension is supposed to be used by first, typically at system startup on each node
 * in the cluster, registering the supported entity types with the [[ClusterSharding#spawn]]
 * method, which returns the `ShardRegion` actor reference for a named entity type.
 * Messages to the entities are always sent via that `ActorRef`, i.e. the local `ShardRegion`.
 * Messages can also be sent via the [[EntityRef]] retrieved with [[ClusterSharding#entityRefFor]],
 * which will also send via the local `ShardRegion`.
 *
 * Some settings can be configured as described in the `akka.cluster.sharding`
 * section of the `reference.conf`.
 *
 * The `ShardRegion` actor is started on each node in the cluster, or group of nodes
 * tagged with a specific role. The `ShardRegion` is created with a [[ShardingMessageExtractor]]
 * to extract the entity identifier and the shard identifier from incoming messages.
 * A shard is a group of entities that will be managed together. For the first message in a
 * specific shard the `ShardRegion` requests the location of the shard from a central coordinator,
 * the [[ShardCoordinator]]. The `ShardCoordinator` decides which `ShardRegion`
 * owns the shard. The `ShardRegion` receives the decided home of the shard
 * and if that is the `ShardRegion` instance itself it will create a local child
 * actor representing the entity and direct all messages for that entity to it.
 * If the shard home is another `ShardRegion` instance messages will be forwarded
 * to that `ShardRegion` instance instead. While resolving the location of a
 * shard incoming messages for that shard are buffered and later delivered when the
 * shard location is known. Subsequent messages to the resolved shard can be delivered
 * to the target destination immediately without involving the `ShardCoordinator`.
 *
 * To make sure that at most one instance of a specific entity actor is running somewhere
 * in the cluster it is important that all nodes have the same view of where the shards
 * are located. Therefore the shard allocation decisions are taken by the central
 * `ShardCoordinator`, which is running as a cluster singleton, i.e. one instance on
 * the oldest member among all cluster nodes or a group of nodes tagged with a specific
 * role. The oldest member can be determined by [[akka.cluster.Member#isOlderThan]].
 *
 * To be able to use newly added members in the cluster the coordinator facilitates rebalancing
 * of shards, i.e. migrate entities from one node to another. In the rebalance process the
 * coordinator first notifies all `ShardRegion` actors that a handoff for a shard has started.
 * That means they will start buffering incoming messages for that shard, in the same way as if the
 * shard location is unknown. During the rebalance process the coordinator will not answer any
 * requests for the location of shards that are being rebalanced, i.e. local buffering will
 * continue until the handoff is completed. The `ShardRegion` responsible for the rebalanced shard
 * will stop all entities in that shard by sending the `handOffMessage` to them. When all entities have
 * been terminated the `ShardRegion` owning the entities will acknowledge the handoff as completed
 * to the coordinator. Thereafter the coordinator will reply to requests for the location of
 * the shard and thereby allocate a new home for the shard and then buffered messages in the
 * `ShardRegion` actors are delivered to the new location. This means that the state of the entities
 * are not transferred or migrated. If the state of the entities are of importance it should be
 * persistent (durable), e.g. with `akka-persistence`, so that it can be recovered at the new
 * location.
 *
 * The logic that decides which shards to rebalance is defined in a plugable shard
 * allocation strategy. The default implementation [[LeastShardAllocationStrategy]]
 * picks shards for handoff from the `ShardRegion` with most number of previously allocated shards.
 * They will then be allocated to the `ShardRegion` with least number of previously allocated shards,
 * i.e. new members in the cluster. There is a configurable threshold of how large the difference
 * must be to begin the rebalancing. This strategy can be replaced by an application specific
 * implementation.
 *
 * The state of shard locations in the `ShardCoordinator` is stored with `akka-distributed-data` or
 * `akka-persistence` to survive failures. When a crashed or unreachable coordinator
 * node has been removed (via down) from the cluster a new `ShardCoordinator` singleton
 * actor will take over and the state is recovered. During such a failure period shards
 * with known location are still available, while messages for new (unknown) shards
 * are buffered until the new `ShardCoordinator` becomes available.
 *
 * As long as a sender uses the same `ShardRegion` actor to deliver messages to an entity
 * actor the order of the messages is preserved. As long as the buffer limit is not reached
 * messages are delivered on a best effort basis, with at-most once delivery semantics,
 * in the same way as ordinary message sending. Reliable end-to-end messaging, with
 * at-least-once semantics can be added by using `AtLeastOnceDelivery` in `akka-persistence`.
 *
 * Some additional latency is introduced for messages targeted to new or previously
 * unused shards due to the round-trip to the coordinator. Rebalancing of shards may
 * also add latency. This should be considered when designing the application specific
 * shard resolution, e.g. to avoid too fine grained shards.
 *
 * The `ShardRegion` actor can also be started in proxy only mode, i.e. it will not
 * host any entities itself, but knows how to delegate messages to the right location.
 *
 * If the state of the entities are persistent you may stop entities that are not used to
 * reduce memory consumption. This is done by the application specific implementation of
 * the entity actors for example by defining receive timeout (`context.setReceiveTimeout`).
 * If a message is already enqueued to the entity when it stops itself the enqueued message
 * in the mailbox will be dropped. To support graceful passivation without losing such
 * messages the entity actor can send [[ShardRegion.Passivate]] to its parent `ShardRegion`.
 * The specified wrapped message in `Passivate` will be sent back to the entity, which is
 * then supposed to stop itself. Incoming messages will be buffered by the `ShardRegion`
 * between reception of `Passivate` and termination of the entity. Such buffered messages
 * are thereafter delivered to a new incarnation of the entity.

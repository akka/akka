/**
 * This extension runs a pre set number of actors in a cluster.
 *
 * The typical use case is when you have a task that can be divided in a number of workers, each doing a
 * sharded part of the work, for example consuming the read side events from Akka Persistence through
 * tagged events where each tag decides which consumer that should consume the event.
 *
 * Each named set needs to be started on all the nodes of the cluster on start up.
 *
 * The processes are spread out across the cluster, when the cluster topology changes the processes may be stopped
 * and started anew on a new node to rebalance them.
 *
 * Not for user extension.

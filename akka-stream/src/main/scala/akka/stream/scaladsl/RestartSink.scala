 * A RestartSink wraps a [[Sink]] that gets restarted when it completes or fails.

 * They are useful for graphs that need to run for longer than the [[Sink]] can necessarily guarantee it will, for
 * example, for [[Sink]] streams that depend on a remote server that may crash or become partitioned. The
 * RestartSink ensures that the graph can continue running while the [[Sink]] restarts.

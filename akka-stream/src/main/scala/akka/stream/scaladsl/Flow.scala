/**
 * The Flow DSL allows the formulation of stream transformations based on some
 * input. The starting point can be a collection, an iterator, a block of code
 * which is evaluated repeatedly or a [[org.reactivestreams.api.Producer]].
 *
 * See <a href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams/">Reactive Streams</a> for details.
 *
 * Each DSL element produces a new Flow that can be further transformed, building
 * up a description of the complete transformation pipeline. In order to execute
 * this pipeline the Flow must be materialized by calling the [[#toFuture]], [[#consume]]
 * or [[#toProducer]] methods on it.
 *
 * It should be noted that the streams modeled by this library are “hot”,
 * meaning that they asynchronously flow through a series of processors without
 * detailed control by the user. In particular it is not predictable how many
 * elements a given transformation step might buffer before handing elements
 * downstream, which means that transformation functions may be invoked more
 * often than for corresponding transformations on strict collections like
 * [[List]]. *An important consequence* is that elements that were produced
 * into a stream may be discarded by later processors, e.g. when using the
 * [[#take]] combinator.
 *
 * By default every operation is executed within its own [[akka.actor.Actor]]
 * to enable full pipelining of the chained set of computations. This behavior
 * is determined by the [[akka.stream.FlowMaterializer]] which is required
 * by those methods that materialize the Flow into a series of
 * [[org.reactivestreams.api.Processor]] instances. The returned reactive stream
 * is fully started and active.

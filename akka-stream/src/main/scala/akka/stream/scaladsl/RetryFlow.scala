  /**
   * Allows retrying individual elements in the stream with an exponential backoff.
   *
   * The retry condition is controlled by the `decideRetry` function. It takes the originally emitted
   * element and the response emitted by `flow`, and may return a request to be retried.
   *
   * The implementation of the `RetryFlow` requires that `flow` follows strict first-in-first-out and
   * one-in-one-out semantics, i.e., the [[akka.stream.scaladsl.Flow Flow]] may neither filter elements,
   * nor emit more than one element per incoming element. The `RetryFlow` will fail if two elements
   * are emitted for one incoming element. Any sort of batching, grouping, or filtering
   * will make it hang forever.
   *
   * Just one element will be emitted into the `flow` at any time.
   * Let's say the flow is handling an element, either first-time executing some calculation, or retrying.
   * The next element won't be emitted into the flow until the current element has been finished processing.
   * By finished, it means either succeed the very first attempt, succeed after a few attempts, or get dropped after
   * using up [[maxRetries]] retries.

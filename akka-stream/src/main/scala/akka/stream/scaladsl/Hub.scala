       *  (2) the consumer is not running right now
       *  (3) no wakeupCallbacks are pending

       *      'tryProcessNext' method
       *  (6) There must have been one producer that observed needWakeup = false. This follows from (4) and (3)
       *      and the implementation of this method. In addition, this producer arrived after needWakeup = true,
       *      since before that, every queued elements have been consumed.
       *  (7) There have been at least one producer that observed needWakeup = true and enqueued an element and
       *      a wakeup signal. This follows from (5) and (6), and the fact that either this method sets
       *      needWakeup = false, or the 'tryProcessNext' method, i.e. a wakeup must happened since (5)
       *  (8) If there were multiple producers satisfying (6) take the last one. Due to (6), (3) and (4) we know
       *      there cannot be a wakeup pending, and we just enqueued an element, so (1) holds. Since we are the last
       *      one, (2) must be true or there is no lost wakeup. However, due to (7) we know there was at least one
       *      wakeup (otherwise needWakeup = true). Now, if the consumer is still running (2) is violated,
       *      if not running then needWakeup = false is violated (which comes from (6)). No matter what,

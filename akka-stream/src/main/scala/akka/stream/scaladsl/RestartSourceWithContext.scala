 * A RestartSourceWithContext wraps a [[SourceWithContext]] that gets restarted when it completes or fails.

 * They are useful for graphs that need to run for longer than the [[SourceWithContext]] can necessarily guarantee it will,
 * e.g. for [[SourceWithContext]] streams that depend on a remote service to which connectivity may be lost (crash or partition).  The RestartSourceWithContext ensures that the graph can continue running while the [[SourceWithContext]] restarts.

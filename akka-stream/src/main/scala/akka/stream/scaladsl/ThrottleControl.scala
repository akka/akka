   * Call this (side-effecting) method whenever an element should be passed through the token-bucket. This method

   * Returns zero if the element can be emitted immediately. The method does not handle overflow, if an element is to
   * be delayed longer in nanoseconds than what can be represented as a positive Long then an undefined value is returned.
   *
   * If a non-zero value is returned, it is the responsibility of the caller to not call this method before the
   * returned delay has been elapsed (but can be called later). This class does not check or protect against early
   * calls.
   *
   * @param cost How many tokens the element costs. Can be larger than the capacity of the bucket.

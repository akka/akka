/**
 * General interface for stream transformation.
 *
 * Custom `Stage` implementations are intended to be used with
 * [[akka.stream.scaladsl.FlowOps#transform]] or
 * [[akka.stream.javadsl.Flow#transform]] to extend the `Flow` API when there
 * is no specialized operator that performs the transformation.
 *
 * Custom implementations are subclasses of [[PushPullStage]] or
 * [[DetachedStage]]. Sometimes it is convenient to extend
 * [[StatefulStage]] for support of become like behavior.
 *
 * It is possible to keep state in the concrete `Stage` instance with
 * ordinary instance variables. The `Transformer` is executed by an actor and
 * therefore you do not have to add any additional thread safety or memory
 * visibility constructs to access the state from the callback methods.

/**
 * `PushPullStage` implementations participate in 1-bounded regions. For every external non-completion signal these

 * in `onPush` you are allowed to call [[Context#push]] to emit one element downstreams, or you can absorb the
 * element by calling [[Context#pull]]. Note that you can only emit zero or one element downstream from `onPull`.
 * To emit more than one element you have to push the remaining elements from [[#onPull]], one-by-one.
 * `onPush` is not called again until `onPull` has requested more elements with [[Context#pull]].
 *
 * [[StatefulStage]] has support for making it easy to emit more than one element from `onPush`.
 *
 * [[#onPull]] is called when there is demand from downstream, i.e. you are allowed to push one element
 * downstreams with [[Context#push]], or request elements from upstreams with [[Context#pull]]. If you
 * always perform transitive pull by calling `ctx.pull` from `onPull` you can use [[PushStage]] instead of
 * `PushPullStage`.
 *
 * Stages are allowed to do early completion of downstream and cancel of upstream. This is done with [[Context#finish]],
 * which is a combination of cancel/complete.
 *
 * Since onComplete is not a backpressured signal it is sometimes preferable to push a final element and then
 * immediately finish. This combination is exposed as [[Context#pushAndFinish]] which enables stages to
 * propagate completion events without waiting for an extra round of pull.
 *
 * Another peculiarity is how to convert termination events (complete/failure) into elements. The problem
 * here is that the termination events are not backpressured while elements are. This means that simply calling
 * [[Context#push]] as a response to [[#onUpstreamFinish]] or [[#onUpstreamFailure]] will very likely break boundedness
 * and result in a buffer overflow somewhere. Therefore the only allowed command in this case is
 * [[Context#absorbTermination]] which stops the propagation of the termination signal, and puts the stage in a
 * [[akka.stream.stage.Context#isFinishing]] state. Depending on whether the stage has a pending pull signal it
 * has not yet "consumed" by a push its [[#onPull]] handler might be called immediately or later. From
 * [[#onPull]] final elements can be pushed before completing downstream with [[Context#finish]] or
 * [[Context#pushAndFinish]].
 *
 * [[StatefulStage]] has support for making it easy to emit final elements.
 *
 * All these rules are enforced by types and runtime checks where needed. Always return the `Directive`
 * from the call to the [[Context]] method, and do only call [[Context]] commands once per callback.
 *

 * @see [[StatefulStage]]

 *
 * `DetachedStage` implementations are boundaries between 1-bounded regions. This means that they need to enforce the
 * "exactly one" property both on their upstream and downstream regions. As a consequence a `DetachedStage` can never

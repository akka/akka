/**
 * This class holds some graph transformation functions that can fuse together
 * multiple operation stages into synchronous execution islands. The purpose is
 * to reduce the number of Actors that are created in order to execute the stream
 * and thereby improve start-up cost as well as reduce element traversal latency
 * for large graphs. Fusing itself is a time-consuming operation, meaning that
 * usually it is best to cache the result of this computation and reuse it instead
 * of fusing the same graph many times.
 *
 * Fusing together all operations which allow this treatment will reduce the
 * parallelism that is available in the stream graph’s execution—in the worst case
 * it will become single-threaded and not benefit from multiple CPU cores at all.
 * Where parallelism is required, the [[akka.stream.Attributes#AsyncBoundary]]
 * attribute can be used to declare subgraph boundaries across which the graph
 * shall not be fused.

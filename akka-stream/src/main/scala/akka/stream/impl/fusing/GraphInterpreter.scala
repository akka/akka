/**
 * INTERNAL API
 *
 * From an external viewpoint, the GraphInterpreter takes an assembly of graph processing stages encoded as a
 * [[GraphInterpreter#GraphAssembly]] object and provides facilities to execute and interact with this assembly.
 * The lifecycle of the Interpreter is roughly the following:
 *  - [[init()]] is called
 *  - [[execute()]] is called whenever there is need for execution, providing an upper limit on the processed events
 *  - [[finish()]] is called before the interpreter is disposed, preferably after [[isCompleted]] returned true, although
 *    in abort cases this is not strictly necessary
 *
 * The [[execute()]] method of the interpreter accepts an upper bound on the events it will process. After this limit
 * is reached or there are no more pending events to be processed, the call returns. It is possible to inspect
 * if there are unprocessed events left via the [[isSuspended]] method. [[isCompleted]] returns true once all operators
 * reported completion inside the interpreter.
 *
 * The internal architecture of the interpreter is based on the usage of arrays and optimized for reducing allocations
 * on the hot paths.
 *
 * One of the basic abstractions inside the interpreter is the [[akka.stream.impl.fusing.GraphInterpreter.Connection]].
 * A connection represents an output-input port pair (an analogue for a connected RS Publisher-Subscriber pair).
 * The Connection object contains all the necessary data for the interpreter to pass elements, demand, completion
 * or errors across the Connection.
 * In particular
 *  - portStates contains a bitfield that tracks the states of the ports (output-input) corresponding to this
 *    connection. This bitfield is used to decode the event that is in-flight.
 *  - connectionSlot contains a potential element or exception that accompanies the
 *    event encoded in the portStates bitfield
 *  - inHandler contains the [[InHandler]] instance that handles the events corresponding
 *    to the input port of the connection
 *  - outHandler contains the [[OutHandler]] instance that handles the events corresponding
 *    to the output port of the connection
 *
 * On top of the Connection table there is an eventQueue, represented as a circular buffer of Connections. The queue
 * contains the Connections that have pending events to be processed. The pending event itself is encoded
 * in the portState bitfield of the Connection. This implies that there can be only one event in flight for a given
 * Connection, which is true in almost all cases, except a complete-after-push or fail-after-push which has to
 * be decoded accordingly.
 *
 * The layout of the portState bitfield is the following:
 *
 *             |- state machn.-| Only one bit is hot among these bits
 *  64  32  16 | 8   4   2   1 |
 * +---+---+---|---+---+---+---|
 *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  From the following flags only one is active in any given time. These bits encode
 *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  state machine states, and they are "moved" around using XOR masks to keep other bits
 *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |  intact.
 *   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 *   |   |   |   |   |   |   +- InReady:  The input port is ready to be pulled
 *   |   |   |   |   |   +----- Pulling:  A pull is active, but have not arrived yet (queued)
 *   |   |   |   |   +--------- Pushing:  A push is active, but have not arrived yet (queued)
 *   |   |   |   +------------- OutReady: The output port is ready to be pushed
 *   |   |   |
 *   |   |   +----------------- InClosed:  The input port is closed and will not receive any events.
 *   |   |                                 A push might be still in flight which will be then processed first.
 *   |   +--------------------- OutClosed: The output port is closed and will not receive any events.
 *   +------------------------- InFailed:  Always set in conjunction with InClosed. Indicates that the close event
 *                                         is a failure
 *
 * Sending an event is usually the following sequence:
 *  - An action is requested by an operator logic (push, pull, complete, etc.)
 *  - the state machine in portStates is transitioned from a ready state to a pending event
 *  - the affected Connection is enqueued
 *
 * Receiving an event is usually the following sequence:
 *  - the Connection to be processed is dequeued
 *  - the type of the event is determined from the bits set on portStates
 *  - the state machine in portStates is transitioned to a ready state
 *  - using the inHandlers/outHandlers table the corresponding callback is called on the operator logic.
 *
 * Because of the FIFO construction of the queue the interpreter is fair, i.e. a pending event is always executed
 * after a bounded number of other events. This property, together with suspendability means that even infinite cycles can
 * be modeled, or even dissolved (if preempted and a "stealing" external event is injected; for example the non-cycle
 * edge of a balance is pulled, dissolving the original cycle).

         * dispatch is that chased events are never touching the event queue, they use a "streamlined" execution path
         * instead. Looking at the scenario of a Push, the following events will happen.
         *  - "normal" dispatch executes an onPush event
         *  - stage eventually calls push()
         *  - code inside the push() method checks the validity of the call, and also if it can be safely ignored
         *    (because the target stage already completed we just have not been notified yet)
         *  - if the upper limit of ChaseLimit has not been reached, then the Connection is put into the chasedPush
         *    variable
         *  - the loop below immediately captures this push and dispatches it
         *
         * What is saved by this optimization is three steps:
         *  - no need to enqueue the Connection in the queue (array), it ends up in a simple variable, reducing
         *    pressure on array load-store
         *  - no need to dequeue the Connection from the queue, similar to above
         *  - no need to decode the event, we know it is a Push already
         *  - no need to check for validity of the event because we already checked at the push() call, and there
         *    can be no concurrent events interleaved unlike with the normal dispatch (think about a cancel() that is
         *    called in the target stage just before the onPush() arrives). This avoids unnecessary branching.

/**
 * INTERNAL API
 *
 * One-bounded interpreter for a linear chain of stream operations (graph support is possible and will be implemented
 * later)
 *
 * The ideas in this interpreter are an amalgamation of earlier ideas, notably:
 *  - The original effect-tracking implementation by Johannes Rudolph -- the difference here that effects are not chained
 *  together as classes but the callstack is used instead and only certain combinations are allowed.
 *  - The on-stack reentrant implementation by Mathias Doenitz -- the difference here that reentrancy is handled by the
 *  interpreter itself, not user code, and the interpreter is able to use the heap when needed instead of the
 *  callstack.
 *  - The pinball interpreter by Endre SÃ¡ndor Varga -- the difference here that the restricition for "one ball" is
 *  lifted by using isolated execution regions, completion handling is introduced and communication with the external
 *  world is done via boundary ops.
 *
 * The design goals/features of this interpreter are:
 *  - bounded callstack and heapless execution whenever possible
 *  - callstack usage should be constant for the most common ops independently of the size of the op-chain
 *  - allocation-free execution on the hot paths
 *  - enforced backpressure-safety (boundedness) on user defined ops at compile-time (and runtime in a few cases)
 *
 * The main driving idea of this interpreter is the concept of 1-bounded execution of well-formed free choice Petri
 * nets (J. Desel and J. Esparza: Free Choice Petri Nets - https://www7.in.tum.de/~esparza/bookfc.html). Technically
 * different kinds of operations partition the chain of ops into regions where *exactly one* event is active all the
 * time. This "exactly one" property is enforced by proper types and runtime checks where needed. Currently there are
 * three kinds of ops:
 *
 *  - PushPullStage implementations participate in 1-bounded regions. For every external non-completion signal these
 *  ops produce *exactly one* signal (completion is different, explained later) therefore keeping the number of events
 *  the same: exactly one.
 *
 *  - DetachedStage implementations are boundaries between 1-bounded regions. This means that they need to enforce the
 *  "exactly one" property both on their upstream and downstream regions. As a consequence a DetachedStage can never
 *  answer an onPull with a ctx.pull() or answer an onPush() with a ctx.push() since such an action would "steal"
 *  the event from one region (resulting in zero signals) and would inject it to the other region (resulting in two
 *  signals). However DetachedStages have the ability to call ctx.hold() as a response to onPush/onPull which temporarily
 *  takes the signal off and stops execution, at the same time putting the op in a "holding" state. If the op is in a
 *  holding state it contains one absorbed signal, therefore in this state the only possible command to call is
 *  ctx.pushAndPull() which results in two events making the balance right again:
 *  1 hold + 1 external event = 2 external event
 *  This mechanism allows synchronization between the upstream and downstream regions which otherwise can progress
 *  independently.
 *
 *  - BoundaryStage implementations are meant to communicate with the external world. These ops do not have most of the
 *  safety properties enforced and should be used carefully. One important ability of BoundaryStages that they can take
 *  off an execution signal by calling ctx.exit(). This is typically used immediately after an external signal has
 *  been produced (for example an actor message). BoundaryStages can also kickstart execution by calling enter() which
 *  returns a context they can use to inject signals into the interpreter. There is no checks in place to enforce that
 *  the number of signals taken out by exit() and the number of signals returned via enter() are the same -- using this
 *  op type needs extra care from the implementer.
 *  BoundaryStages are the elements that make the interpreter *tick*, there is no other way to start the interpreter
 *  than using a BoundaryStage.
 *
 * Operations are allowed to do early completion and cancel/complete their upstreams and downstreams. It is *not*
 * allowed however to do these independently to avoid isolated execution islands. The only call possible is ctx.finish()
 * which is a combination of cancel/complete.
 * Since onComplete is not a backpressured signal it is sometimes preferable to push a final element and then immediately
 * finish. This combination is exposed as pushAndFinish() which enables op writers to propagate completion events without
 * waiting for an extra round of pull.
 * Another peculiarity is how to convert termination events (complete/failure) into elements. The problem
 * here is that the termination events are not backpressured while elements are. This means that simply calling ctx.push()
 * as a response to onUpstreamFinished() will very likely break boundedness and result in a buffer overflow somewhere.
 * Therefore the only allowed command in this case is ctx.absorbTermination() which stops the propagation of the
 * termination signal, and puts the op in a finishing state. Depending on whether the op has a pending pull signal it has
 * not yet "consumed" by a push its onPull() handler might be called immediately.
 *
 * In order to execute different individual execution regions the interpreter uses the callstack to schedule these. The
 * current execution forking operations are
 *  - ctx.finish() which starts a wave of completion and cancellation in two directions. When an op calls finish()
 *  it is immediately replaced by an artificial Finished op which makes sure that the two execution paths are isolated
 *  forever.
 *  - ctx.fail() which is similar to finish()
 *  - ctx.pushAndPull() which (as a response to a previous ctx.hold()) starts a wawe of downstream push and upstream
 *  pull. The two execution paths are isolated by the op itself since onPull() from downstream can only answered by hold or
 *  push, while onPush() from upstream can only answered by hold or pull -- it is impossible to "cross" the op.
 *  - ctx.pushAndFinish() which is different from the forking ops above because the execution of push and finish happens on
 *  the same execution region and they are order dependent, too.
 * The interpreter tracks the depth of recursive forking and allows various strategies of dealing with the situation
 * when this depth reaches a certain limit. In the simplest case an error is reported (this is very useful for stress
 * testing and finding callstack wasting bugs), in the other case the forked call is scheduled via a list -- i.e. instead
 * of the stack the heap is used.

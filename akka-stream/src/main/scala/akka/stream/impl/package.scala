/**
 * The architecture of Akka Streams internally consists of several distinct layers:
 *
 *  * The DSLs like [[akka.stream.scaladsl.Flow]], [[akka.stream.scaladsl.Source]] etc. are the user facing API
 *    for composing streams. These DSLs are a thin wrappers around the internal [[akka.stream.impl.TraversalBuilder]]
 *    builder classes. There are Java alternatives of these DSLs in [[javadsl]] which basically wrap their scala
 *    counterpart, delegating method calls.
 *  * The [[akka.stream.stage.GraphStage]] API is the user facing API for creating new stream operators. These
 *    classes are used by the [[akka.stream.impl.fusing.GraphInterpreter]] which executes islands (subgraphs) of these
 *    operators
 *  * The high level DSLs use the [[akka.stream.impl.TraversalBuilder]] classes to build instances of
 *    [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]] which are the representation of a materializable stream description. These builders
 *    are immutable and safely shareable. Unlike the top-level DSLs, these are untyped, i.e. elements are treated as
 *    Any.
 *  * The [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]] is the immutable, efficient representation of a stream processing graph that
 *    can be materialized. The builders exists solely for the purpose of producing a traversal in the end.
 *  * The [[akka.stream.impl.PhasedFusingActorMaterializer]] is the class that is responsible for traversing and
 *    interpreting a [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]]. It delegates the actual task of creating executable entities
 *    and Publishers/Producers to [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]]s which are plugins that understand atomic operators
 *    in the graph and able to turn them into executable entities.
 *  * The [[akka.stream.impl.fusing.GraphInterpreter]] and its actor backed wrapper [[akka.stream.impl.fusing.ActorGraphInterpreter]]
 *    are used to execute synchronous islands (subgraphs) of [[akka.stream.stage.GraphStage]]s.
 *
 * For the execution layer, refer to [[akka.stream.impl.fusing.GraphInterpreter]].
 *
 * == Design goals ==
 *
 * The central piece for both the DSLs and materialization is the [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]]. This is the
 * representation of an Akka Stream, basically a [[akka.stream.scaladsl.RunnableGraph]]. The design goals
 * for [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]] are:
 *
 *   * Be able to materialize a graph in one pass over the traversal
 *   * Unify materialization and fusing. The materializer should be able to construct all the necessary data structures
 *     for the interpreters and for connecting them in one go.
 *   * Avoid allocations as much as possible.
 *   * Biased implementation for the 90% case. Common cases should be as fast as possible:
 *     * wiring linear chains should be very fast.
 *     * assume that most graphs are mostly linear, with only a few generalized graph constructs thrown in.
 *     * materialization should not pay the price of island tracking if there is only a single island
 *     * assume that the number of islands is low in general
 *     * avoid "copiedModule" i.e. wrappers that exist solely for the purpose of establishing new port identities
 *       for operators that are used multiple times in the same graph.
 *   * Avoid hashmaps and prefer direct array lookup wherever possible
 *
 * Semantically, a traversal is a list of commands that the materializer must execute to turn the description to a
 * running stream. In fact, the traversal is nothing more than an immutable list, that is expressed as a tree. A
 * tree is used to make immutable appends fast (immutable lists only have prepend as O(1) operation, append is O(N)).
 * The materializer "recovers" the original sequence by using a local, mutable stack to properly traverse the tree
 * structure. This is way cheaper than to immutably append to the traversal at each addition.
 *
 * The "tree-ness" is expressed by explicit [[akka.stream.impl.Concat]] nodes that express that two traversals
 * need to be traversed in a certain sequence, stashing away the second on a local stack until the first is fully
 * traversed.
 *
 * While traversing the traversal (basically following Concat nodes), the materializer will visit the following
 * command types:
 *
 *  * [[akka.stream.impl.MaterializeAtomic]]: An atomic module needs to be materialized. This node also contains
 *    wiring information which we discuss later.
 *  * Materialized value computation. This is a stack based "sublanguage" to compute the final materialized value
 *    on a stack, maintained by the materializer
 *    * [[akka.stream.impl.PushNotUsed]] push a NotUsed value on the stack
 *    * [[akka.stream.impl.Pop]] pop the top of the stack and throw away
 *    * [[akka.stream.impl.Transform]] take the top of the stack, transform it with the provided function and put
 *      the result back on the top of the stack
 *    * [[akka.stream.impl.Compose]] take the top two values of the stack, invoke the provided function with these
 *      values as arguments, then put the calculated value on the top of the stack
 *    * Materialized values of atomic operators when visiting a [[akka.stream.impl.MaterializeAtomic]] must be
 *      pushed to the stack automatically. There are no explicit PUSH commands for this
 *  * Attributes calculation. These also are a stack language, although much simpler than the materialized value
 *     commands. For any materialized operator, the top of the attributes stack should be provided as the current
 *     effective attributes.
 *    * [[akka.stream.impl.PushAttributes]] combines the attributes on the top of the stack with the given ones and
 *      puts the result on the attributes stack
 *    * [[akka.stream.impl.PopAttributes]] removes the top of the attributes stack.
 *  * Island tracking. Islands serve two purposes. First, they allow a large graph to be cut into parts that execute
 *    concurrently with each other, using asynchronous message passing between themselves. Second, they are an
 *    extension point where "plugins" ([[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]]) can be used to specially handle subgraphs.
 *    Islands can be nested in each other. This makes "holes" in the parent island. Islands also need a stack
 *    as exiting a "hole" means returning to the parent, enclosing island and continuing where left.
 *     * [[akka.stream.impl.EnterIsland]] instructs the materializer that the following commands will belong to
 *       the materialization of a new island (a subgraph). The [[akka.stream.impl.IslandTag]] signals to
 *       the materializer which [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]] should be used to turn operators of this island into
 *       executable entities.
 *     * [[akka.stream.impl.ExitIsland]] instructs the materializer that the current island is done and the parent
 *       island is now the active one again.
 *
 *  Please note that the stack based materialized value computation eliminates the issues present in the older
 *  materializer which expressed these computations as an AST. We had to use optimizations for this tree so that
 *  long Keep.left chains don't explode the stack visiting a large AST. The stack based language sidesteps this issue
 *  completely as the number of these commands don't increase the stack space required to execute them, unless the
 *  computation itself requires it (which is not the case in any sane stream combination).
 *
 *  == Graph model, offsets, slots ==
 *
 *  As a mental model, the wiring part of the Traversal (i.e. excluding the stack based sub-commands tracking
 *  materialized values, attributes, islands, i.e. things that don't contribute to the wiring structure of the graph)
 *  translates everything to a single, global, contiguous Array. Every input and output port of each operator is mapped
 *  to exactly one slot of this "mental array". Input and output ports that are considered wired together simply map
 *  to the same slot. (In practice, these slots might not be mapped to an actual global array, but multiple local arrays
 *  using some translation logic, but we will explain this later)
 *
 *  Input ports are mapped simply to contiguous numbers in the order they are visited. Take for example a simple
 *  traversal:
 *
 *    Operator1[in1, in2, out] - Operator2[out] - Operator3[in]
 *
 *  This results in the following slot assignments:
 *
 *    * Operator1.in1 -> 0
 *    * Operator1.in2 -> 1
 *    * Operator3.in  -> 2
 *
 *  The materializer simply visits Stage1, Stage2, Stage3 in order, visiting the input ports of each operator in order.
 *  It then simply assigns numbers from a counter that is incremented after visiting an input port.
 *  (Please note that all [[akka.stream.impl.StreamLayout.AtomicModule]]s maintain a stable order of their ports, so
 *  this global ordering is well defined)
 *
 *  Before explaining how output wiring works, it is important to settle some terminology. When we talk about ports
 *  we refer to their location in the "mental array" as slots. However, there are other entities that needs to
 *  reference various positions in this "mental array", but in these cases we use the term _offset_ to signify that
 *  these are only used for bookkeeping, they have no "place" in the "array" themselves. In particular:
 *
 *   * offset of a module: The offset of an [[akka.stream.impl.StreamLayout.AtomicModule]] is defined as the value of
 *     the input port counter when visiting the [[akka.stream.impl.MaterializeAtomic]] node to materialize that module.
 *     In other words, the offset of a module is the slot of its first input port (if there is any). Since modules
 *     might not have any input ports it can be that different modules share the same offset, simply because the
 *     the first one visited does not increase the input port counter.
 *   * offset of segments, islands: Defined similarly to module. The offset of an island or a segment is simply the
 *     value of the input port counter (or the first unallocated slot).
 *
 *  For example:
 *
 *    Module1[in1 = 0, in2 = 1] - Module2[out] - Module3[in = 2]
 *
 *  The offset of Module1 is 0, while Module2 and Module3 share the same offset of 2. Note that only input ports (slots)
 *  contribute to the offset of a module in a traversal.
 *
 *  Output ports are wired relative to the offset of the module they are contained in. When the materializer visits
 *  a [[akka.stream.impl.MaterializeAtomic]] node, it contains an Array that maps ports to a relative offset. To
 *  calculate the slot that is assigned to an output port the following formula is used:
 *
 *    slot = offsetOfModule + outToSlots(out.id)
 *
 *  Where outToSlots is the array contained in the [[akka.stream.impl.MaterializeAtomic]] node.
 *
 *  == Relative addressing ==
 *
 *  The power of this structure comes from the fact that slots are assigned in a relative manner:
 *
 *   * input ports are assigned in sequence so the slots assigned to the input ports of a subgraph depend on the
 *     subgraph's position in the traversal
 *   * output ports are assigned relative to the offset of their owner module, which is in turn relative to its first
 *     (potential) input port (which is relative, too, because of the previous point)
 *
 *  This setup allows combining subgraphs without touching their internal wirings as all their internal wirings will
 *  properly resolve due to everything being relative:
 *
 *       +---------------+                     +----+
 *       |               |                     |    |
 *    |---------Graph1---------|--- .... ---|----Graph2----|
 *
 *  It is important to note that due to reusability, an Akka Stream graph may contain the same atomic or composite
 *  multiple times in the same graph. Since these must be distinguished from each other somehow, they need port mapping
 *  (i.e. a new set of ports) to ensure that the ports of one graph are distinguishable from another. Because how
 *  the traversal relative addressing works, these are _temporary_ though, once all internal wirings are ready, these
 *  mappings can be effectively dropped as the global slot assignments uniquely identify what is wired to what. For
 *  example since Graph1 is visited before Graph2 all of the slots or offsets it uses are different from Graph2 leaving
 *  no room for misinterpretation.
 *
 *  == Port mapping ==
 *
 *  Port mapping is the way how the DSL can distinguish between multiple instances of the same graph included multiple
 *  times. For example in the Graph DSL:
 *
 *    val merge1 = builder.add(Merge)
 *    val merge2 = builder.add(Merge)
 *
 *  the port merge1.out must be different from merge2.out.
 *
 *  For efficiency reasons, the linear and graph DSLs use different [[akka.stream.impl.TraversalBuilder]] types to
 *  build the [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]] (we will discuss these next). One of the differences between the two
 *  builders are their approach to port mapping.
 *
 *  The simpler case is the [[akka.stream.impl.LinearTraversalBuilder]]. This builder only allows building linear
 *  chains of operators, hence, it can only have at most one [[OutPort]] and [[InPort]] unwired. Since there is no
 *  possible ambiguity between these two port types, there is no need for port mapping for these. Conversely,
 *  for those internal ports that are already wired, there is no need for port mapping as their relative wiring
 *  is not ambiguous (see previous section). As a result, the [[akka.stream.impl.LinearTraversalBuilder]] does not
 *  use any port mapping.
 *
 *  The generic graph builder class [[akka.stream.impl.CompositeTraversalBuilder]] needs port mapping as it allows
 *  adding any kind of builders in any order. When adding a module (encoded as another [[akka.stream.impl.TraversalBuilder]])
 *  there are two entities in play:
 *
 *   * The module (builder) to be added. This builder has a few ports unwired which are usually packaged in a [[Shape]]
 *     which is stored alongside with the builder in the [[Graph]] of the DSL. When invoking methods on this builder
 *     these set of ports must be used.
 *   * The module that we are growing. This module needs a new set of ports to be used as it might add this module
 *     multiple times and needs to disambiguate these ports.
 *
 *  Adding to the [[akka.stream.impl.CompositeTraversalBuilder]] involves the following steps (pseudocode):
 *
 *     val newShape = shape.deepCopy() // Copy the shape of the module we want to add
 *     val newBuilder = builder.add(submodule, newShape) // Add the module, and register it with the new shape
 *     newBuilder.wire(newShape.in, ...) // Use the new ports to wire
 *
 *  What happens in the background is that [[Shape.deepCopy()]] creates copies of the ports, and fills their
 *  mappedTo field to point to their original port counterpart. Whenever we call wire in the outer module, it
 *  delegates calls to the submodule, but using the original port (as the submodule builder has no knowledge of
 *  the external mapping):
 *
 *      submodule.assign(port.mappedTo, ...) // enclosing module delegating to submodule, translating ports back
 *
 *  Visualizing this relationship:
 *
 *    +----------------------------------+
 *    | in', in" ---------+              | in' and in" both resolve to in
 *    |   | .mappedTo     v .mappedTo    | but they will be used on _different_ builders
 *    | +-------------+ +-------------+  |
 *    | | in          | | in          |  | (delegation happens recursively in AddedModule)
 *    | | AddedModule | | AddedModule |  |
 *
 *  It is worth to note that the submodule might also continue this map-and-delegate chain to further submodules until
 *  a builder is reached that can directly perform the operation. In other words, the depth of nesting is equal to
 *  the length of mappedTo chaining.
 *
 *  IMPORTANT: When wiring in the enclosing module the new ports/shape MUST be used, using the original ports/shape
 *  will lead to incorrect state.
 *
 *  == TraversalBuilders ==
 *
 *  In order to understand why builders are needed, consider wiring two ports together. Actually, we don't need to
 *  wire input ports anywhere. Their slot is implicitly assigned by their position in the traversal, there is no
 *  additional state we need to track. On the other hand, we cannot build a [[akka.stream.impl.MaterializeAtomic]]
 *  node until the mapping array outToSlots is fully calculated. In other words, in reality, we don't wire input ports
 *  anywhere, we only assign output ports to slots. The builders exist mainly to keep track all the necessary
 *  information to be able to assign output ports, build the outToSlots array and finally the [[akka.stream.impl.MaterializeAtomic]]
 *  node. The consequence of this that a [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]] can be constructed as soon as all output ports
 *  are wired ("unwired" inputs don't matter).
 *
 *  There is a specific builder that is used for the cases where all outputs have been wired:
 *  [[akka.stream.impl.CompletedTraversalBuilder]]. This builder type simply contains the completed traversal plus
 *  some additional data. The reason why this builder type exists is to keep auxiliary data structures required for
 *  output port mapping only while they are needed, and shed them as soon as they are not needed anymore. Since builders
 *  may recursively contain other builders, as soon as internals are completed those contained builders transition
 *  to completed state and drop all additional data structures. This is very GC friendly as many intermediate graphs
 *  exist only in a method call, and hence most of the additional data structures are dropped before method return and
 *  can be efficiently collected by the GC.
 *
 *  The most generic builder is [[akka.stream.impl.CompositeTraversalBuilder]]. There are two main considerations
 *  this builder needs to consider:
 *
 *   * Enclosed modules (builders) must have a stable position in the final traversal for relative addressing to work.
 *     Since module offsets are calculated by traversal position, and outputs are wired relative to module offset, this
 *     is critical.
 *   * Enclosed builders might not be complete yet (i.e. have unwired outputs) and hence they cannot immediately give
 *     a Traversal.
 *
 *  The composite builder keeps a temporary list of traversal steps (in reverse order because of immutable lists)
 *  it needs to create once it is completed (all outputs wired). These steps refer to the traversal of submodules
 *  as a [[akka.stream.impl.BuilderKey]] which is just a placeholder where the traversal of the submodule will be
 *  stitched in. This [[akka.stream.impl.BuilderKey]] is also a key to a map which contains the evolving builder.
 *  The importance of this "preimage" traversal is that it keeps position of submodules stable, making relative
 *  addressing possible.
 *
 *  Once the composite is completed, it takes these steps (now reversing it back to normal), and builds the traversal
 *  using the submodule traversals referred to by [[akka.stream.impl.BuilderKey]]. Note that at this point all the
 *  submodules are [[akka.stream.impl.CompletedTraversalBuilder]]s because there are no unwired outputs and hence the
 *  Traversal can be assembled. As the builder evolves over time, more and more of its [[akka.stream.impl.BuilderKey]]s
 *  will refer to [[akka.stream.impl.CompletedTraversalBuilder]]s, shedding much of the temporary data structures.
 *
 *  Refer to [[akka.stream.impl.CompositeTraversalBuilder]] for more details.
 *
 *  The [[akka.stream.impl.LinearTraversalBuilder]] is a much simpler beast. For efficiency, it tries to work as much
 *  as possible directly on the [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]] avoiding auxiliary structures. The two main considerations
 *  for this builder are:
 *
 *   * [[akka.stream.scaladsl.Source]] and [[akka.stream.scaladsl.Flow]] contain an unwired output port. Yet, we would
 *     like to build the traversal directly as much as possible, even though the builder is not yet completed
 *   * [[akka.stream.impl.CompositeTraversalBuilder]]s might be included in a linear chain. These cannot provide a
 *     traversal before they are fully completed.
 *
 *  The linear builder, although it is one class, comes in basically two flavors:
 *
 *   * Purely linear builder: this contains only other linear builders, or all the composites that it includes
 *     have been fully wired before and hence their traversal is now fully incorporated. Basically this kind
 *     of builder only contains the [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]] and only a couple of extra fields.
 *   * Linear builder with an incomplete composite at the end (output): In this case, we have an incomplete composite.
 *     It can only be at the end, since this is the only position where an output port can be unwired. We need to
 *     carry this builder with us until the output port is finally wired, in which case we incorporate its traversal
 *     into the already complete one, and hopefully transition to a purely linear builder.
 *
 *  If we consider the purely linear case, we still need to figure out how can we provide a traversal even though
 *  the last output port is unwired. The trick that is used is to wire this output port optimistically to the
 *  relative address -1 which is almost always correct (why -1? explained a bit later). If it turns out to be incorrect
 *  later, we fix it by the helper method [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal.rewireFirstTo()]] which tears down the traversal
 *  until the wrong module is found, then fixes the port assignment. This is only possible on purely linear layouts though.
 *  Again, this is an example of the 90% rule. Most appends will not need this rewiring and hence be as fast as possible
 *  while the rarer cases suffering a minor penalty.
 *
 *  In the case where the last module is a composite, the above trick would not work as nothing guarantees that the
 *  module that exposed its output port is at an expected position in the traversal. Instead, we simply keep around
 *  this composite and delay construction of its part of the traversal. For details see [[akka.stream.impl.LinearTraversalBuilder]]
 *  as these cases are heavily commented and explained in the code.
 *
 *  There is another peculiarity of the linear builder we need to explain. Namely, it builds the traversal in reverse
 *  order, i.e. from Sinks towards Sources. THIS CAN BE SUPER CONFUSING AT TIMES SO PAY ATTENTION! There are two
 *  important reasons why this is needed:
 *
 *   * Prepending to immutable lists is more efficient. Even though we encode our traversal list as a tree, we would
 *     need stack space at materialization time as much as the length of the list if we would append to it instead of
 *     prepending.
 *   * Prepending means that most output ports refer to slots visited before, i.e. output relative offsets are negative.
 *     This means that during materialization, output ports will be wired to slots that the materializer visited before
 *     which enables an efficient one-pass materialization design. The importance of this is discussed later below.
 *
 *  To visualize this, imagine a simple stream:
 *
 *    [Source.out] -> [Map.in, Map.out] -> [Sink.in]
 *
 *  The traversal:
 *
 *     offs = 0         offs = 1                      offs = 1
 *    [Sink.in = 0] <- [Map.in = 1, Map.out = -1] <- [Source.out = -1]
 *
 *  Since the traversal steps are reversed compared to the DSL order, it is important to reverse materialized value
 *  computation, too.
 *
 *  == Islands and local slots ==
 *
 *  All what we have discussed so far referred to the "mental array", the global address space in which slots
 *  are assigned to ports. This model describes the wiring of the graph perfectly, but it does not map to the local
 *  data structures needed by materialization when there are islands present. One of the important goals of this
 *  layout data structure is to be able to produce the data structures used by the [[akka.stream.impl.fusing.GraphInterpreter]]
 *  directly, without much translation. Unfortunately if there is an island inside a traversal, it might leave gaps
 *  in the address space:
 *
 *    |----Island1-----|----Island2(enclosed)----|-----Island1-----|
 *
 *  Since we visit Island2 before returning to Island1, the naive approach would leave a large gap between the last
 *  input port visited before entering Island2 and the first input port visited when returning to Island1. What
 *  we would like to have instead is a contiguous slot assignment from the viewpoint of Island1. This is where
 *  [[akka.stream.impl.PhasedFusingActorMaterializer]] and its [[akka.stream.impl.IslandTracking]] helper comes into
 *  the picture. These classes do the heavy-lifting of traversing the traversal and then mapping global slots to
 *  slots local to the island, delegating then the local wiring to [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]] implementations.
 *  For example the [[akka.stream.impl.GraphStageIsland]] sees only a contigous slot-space and hence it can directly
 *  construct the array for the interpreter. It is not aware of the presence of other islands or how it is represented
 *  in the global slot-space.
 *
 *  == Materialization ==
 *
 *  Materialzation is orchestrated by the [[akka.stream.impl.PhasedFusingActorMaterializer]]. It basically decodes the
 *  traversal and handles islands. This top-level materializer does not really handle the wiring _inside_ an island,
 *  it only handles wiring of Publishers and Subscribers that connect islands. Instead it delegates in-island wiring
 *  to [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]]s. For example a default fused island will be actually wired by
 *  [[akka.stream.impl.GraphStageIsland]].
 *
 *  First, look at a traversal that has two islands:
 *
 *    |----Island1-----|----Island2(enclosed)----|-----Island1-----|
 *
 *  In this traversal, we have two islands, and three, so called _segments_. Segments are simply contiguous range of
 *  slots between [[akka.stream.impl.EnterIsland]] or [[akka.stream.impl.ExitIsland]] tags (in any combination). When
 *  the materializer encounters either an enter or exit command, it saves various information about the segment it
 *  just completed (what is its offset, how long it is measured in input slots, etc.). This information is later
 *  used to figure out if a wiring crosses island boundaries or is it local to the island.
 *
 *  It is important to note that the data structure for this is only allocated when there are islands. This is again
 *  the 90% rule in action. In addition, these data structures are [[java.util.ArrayList]] instances, where lookups
 *  according to some value are implemented as simple linear scans. Since in 90% of the cases these structures are
 *  very short, this is the most efficient approach. Cases where this can be a performance problem are very-very special
 *  and likely not happen in practice (no graph should contain more than a dozen of islands for example).
 *
 *  When it comes to deciding whether a wiring is cross-island or local, there are two cases possible:
 *
 *   * we encountered an output port that is wired backwards (relative address is negative). In this case we already
 *     have all the data necessary to resolve the question.
 *   * we encountered an output port that is wired forward (relative address is positive). In this case we have not
 *     yet visited that part of the traversal where the assignment points.
 *
 *  If we want to keep the one-pass design of the materializer, we need to delay forward wirings until we have all
 *  the information needed, i.e. we visit the target in port. The [[akka.stream.impl.PhasedFusingActorMaterializer]]
 *  has a data structure for tracking forward wires which it consults whenever it visits an input port. Again, this
 *  is only allocated if needed, and it is again an array with linear scan lookup. Once the target input port have
 *  been found, the rules of the wiring are the same as for backwards wiring.
 *
 *        backward wire (to the visited part) <------+ +------> forward wire (into the unknown)
 *                                                   | |
 *   |----Island1-----|----Island2(enclosed)-------- ... (this is where we are now)
 *
 *  Remember, the [[akka.stream.impl.LinearTraversalBuilder]] builds its [[akka.stream.impl.Traversal]] in backwards
 *  order, so since most of the graphs are constructed by the linear DSLs almost all wirings will be backwards
 *  (90% rule in action again).
 *
 *  === Backward wirings ===
 *
 *  When it comes to resolving wirings and calculating the local slots for all the islands involved there are three
 *  distinct cases.
 *
 *  A wiring can be in-segment:
 *
 *                         +--------------+
 *                         |              |
 *    |----Island1-----|----Island2(enclosed)----|-----Island1-----|
 *
 *  This means that the slot assigned to the output port still belongs to the current segment. This is easy to detect
 *  as the [[akka.stream.impl.IslandTracking]] class tracks the offset of the current segment. If the target input
 *  slot is larger or equal than this offset, and the wiring is backwards, then the wiring is strictly local to the
 *  island. The materializer will simply delegate to the [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]] to do the internal wiring.
 *  Since we know the offset of the segment in the local space of this island, calculating the local slot for the
 *  [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]] is simple. (This is fully documented with diagrams
 *  in [[akka.stream.impl.IslandTracking]])
 *
 *  A wiring can be cross-segment, in-island:
 *
 *                +---------------------------------+
 *                |                                 |
 *    |----Island1-----|----Island2(enclosed)----|-----Island1-----|
 *
 *  In this case, the target slot is in another, but already visited segment. The [[akka.stream.impl.IslandTracking]]
 *  class needs to first find the segment in which the target slot is. Since each segment keeps a reference to its
 *  [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]] instance that handles the internal wiring a simple reference equality check
 *  will tell us if the target segment is in the same island or not. In this case it is, so all we need is to
 *  compensate for any possible holes (punched by enclosed islands) to calculate the local slot for the island
 *  and call the appropriate callback on the [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]]. (This is fully documented with diagrams
 *  in [[akka.stream.impl.IslandTracking]])
 *
 *  Finally a wiring can be cross-segment, cross-island:
 *
 *                         +------------------------+
 *                         |                        |
 *    |----Island1-----|----Island2(enclosed)----|-----Island1-----|
 *
 *  This means, that the steps were similar as in the previous case until that point where we check the reference
 *  equality of the current [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]] with that of the target segment (we have already found
 *  the target segment). In this case, we need to calculate the local slot in the target island (similar to the
 *  previous case) and try to wire the two islands together. Now, instead of delegating the wiring to the phases, we
 *  ask the output [[akka.stream.impl.PhaseIsland]] to provide a Publisher and then we ask the target island to
 *  take this Publisher.
 *
 *  Refer to [[akka.stream.impl.IslandTracking]] for all the nasty details of local slot resolution. It is also
 *  recommended to try out a few examples with [[akka.stream.impl.PhasedFusingActorMaterializer.Debug]] turned on, it
 *  will detail every step of the island tracking and slot resolution steps.
 *
 *  == Utilities ==
 *
 *  Useful utilities are:
 *
 *   * [[akka.stream.impl.PhasedFusingActorMaterializer.Debug]]: if this flag is turned on, the materializer will
 *     log the steps it takes
 *   * [[akka.stream.impl.TraversalBuilder.printTraversal()]]: Prints the Traversal in a readable format
 *   * [[akka.stream.impl.TraversalBuilder.printWiring()]]: Prints the calculated port assignments. Useful for
 *     debugging if everything is wired to the right thing.

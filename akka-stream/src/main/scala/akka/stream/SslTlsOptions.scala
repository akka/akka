/**
 * All streams in Akka are unidirectional: while in a complex flow graph data
 * may flow in multiple directions these individual flows are independent from
 * each other. The difference between two half-duplex connections in opposite
 * directions and a full-duplex connection is that the underlying transport
 * is shared in the latter and tearing it down will end the data transfer in
 * both directions.
 *
 * When integrating a full-duplex transport medium that does not support
 * half-closing (which means ending one direction of data transfer without
 * ending the other) into a stream topology, there can be unexpected effects.
 * Feeding a finite Source into this medium will close the connection after
 * all elements have been sent, which means that possible replies may not
 * be received in full. To support this type of usage, the sending and
 * receiving of data on the same side (e.g. on the [[Client]]) need to be
 * coordinated such that it is known when all replies have been received.
 * Only then should the transport be shut down.
 *
 * To support these scenarios it is recommended that the full-duplex
 * transport integration is configurable in terms of termination handling,
 * which means that the user can optionally suppress the normal (closing)
 * reaction to completion or cancellation events, as is expressed by the
 * possible values of this type:
 *
 *  - [[EagerClose]] means to not ignore signals
 *  - [[IgnoreCancel]] means to not react to cancellation of the receiving
 *    side unless the sending side has already completed
 *  - [[IgnoreComplete]] means to not react to the completion of the sending
 *    side unless the receiving side has already canceled
 *  - [[IgnoreBoth]] means to ignore the first termination signal—be that
 *    cancellation or completion—and only act upon the second one

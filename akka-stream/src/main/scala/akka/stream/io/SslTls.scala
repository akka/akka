/**
 * Stream cipher support based upon JSSE.
 *
 * The underlying SSLEngine has four ports: plaintext input/output and
 * ciphertext input/output. These are modeled as a [[akka.stream.BidiShape]]
 * element for use in stream topologies, where the plaintext ports are on the
 * left hand side of the shape and the ciphertext ports on the right hand side.
 *
 * Configuring JSSE is a rather complex topic, please refer to the JDK platform
 * documentation or the excellent user guide that is part of the Play Framework
 * documentation. The philosophy of this integration into Akka Streams is to
 * expose all knobs and dials to client code and therefore not limit the
 * configuration possibilities. In particular the client code will have to
 * provide the SSLContext from which the SSLEngine is then created. Handshake
 * parameters are set using [[NegotiateNewSession]] messages, the settings for
 * the initial handshake need to be provided up front using the same class;
 * please refer to the method documentation below.
 *
 * '''IMPORTANT NOTE'''
 *
 * The TLS specification does not permit half-closing of the user data session
 * that it transports—to be precise a half-close will always promptly lead to a
 * full close. This means that canceling the plaintext output or completing the
 * plaintext input of the SslTls stage will lead to full termination of the
 * secure connection without regard to whether bytes are remaining to be sent or
 * received, respectively. Especially for a client the common idiom of attaching
 * a finite Source to the plaintext input and transforming the plaintext response
 * bytes coming out will not work out of the box due to early termination of the
 * connection. For this reason there is a parameter that determines whether the
 * SslTls stage shall ignore completion and/or cancellation events, and the
 * default is to ignore completion (in view of the client–server scenario). In
 * order to terminate the connection the client will then need to cancel the
 * plaintext output as soon as all expected bytes have been received. When
 * ignoring both types of events the stage will shut down once both events have
 * been received. See also [[Closing]].

/**
 * All streams in Akka are unidirectional: while in a complex flow graph data
 * may flow in multiple directions these individual flows are independent from
 * each other. The difference between two half-duplex connections in opposite
 * directions and a full-duplex connection is that the underlying transport
 * is shared in the latter and tearing it down will end the data transfer in
 * both directions.
 *
 * When integrating a full-duplex transport medium that does not support
 * half-closing (which means ending one direction of data transfer without
 * ending the other) into a stream topology, there can be unexpected effects.
 * Feeding a finite Source into this medium will close the connection after
 * all elements have been sent, which means that possible replies may not
 * be received in full. To support this type of usage, the sending and
 * receiving of data on the same side (e.g. on the [[Client]]) need to be
 * coordinated such that it is known when all replies have been received.
 * Only then should the transport be shut down.
 *
 * To support these scenarios it is recommended that the full-duplex
 * transport integration is configurable in terms of termination handling,
 * which means that the user can optionally suppress the normal (closing)
 * reaction to completion or cancellation events, as is expressed by the
 * possible values of this type:
 *
 *  - [[EagerClose]] means to not ignore signals
 *  - [[IgnoreCancel]] means to not react to cancellation of the receiving
 *    side unless the sending side has already completed
 *  - [[IgnoreComplete]] means to not react to the completion of the sending
 *    side unless the receiving side has already canceled
 *  - [[IgnoreBoth]] means to ignore the first termination signal—be that
 *    cancellation or completion—and only act upon the second one

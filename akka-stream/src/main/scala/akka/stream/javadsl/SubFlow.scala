   * the implementation to avoid using the scheduler when input rates fall below the enforced limit and to reduce
   * most of the inaccuracy caused by the scheduler resolution (which is in the range of milliseconds).

   * Throttler always enforces the rate limit, but in certain cases (mostly due to limited scheduler resolution) it
   * enforces a tighter bound than what was prescribed. This can be also mitigated by increasing the burst size.

  /**
   * API may change!

   * Allows retrying individual elements in the stream with an exponential backoff.
   *
   * The retry condition is controlled by the `decideRetry` function. It takes the originally emitted
   * element and the response emitted by `flow`, and may return a request to be retried.
   *
   * The implementation of the `RetryFlow` requires that `flow` follows one-in-one-out semantics,
   * the [[akka.stream.javadsl.Flow Flow]] may not filter elements,
   * nor emit more than one element per incoming element. The `RetryFlow` will fail if two elements are
   * emitted from the `flow`, it will be stuck "forever" if nothing is emitted. Just one element will
   * be emitted into the `flow` at any time. The `flow` needs to emit an element before the next
   * will be emitted to it.
   *
   * @param minBackoff minimum duration to backoff between issuing retries
   * @param maxBackoff maximum duration to backoff between issuing retries
   * @param randomFactor adds jitter to the retry delay. Use 0 for no jitter
   * @param flow a flow to retry elements from
   * @param decideRetry retry condition decision function

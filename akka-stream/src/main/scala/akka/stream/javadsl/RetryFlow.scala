  /**
   * Allows retrying individual elements in the stream with an exponential backoff.
   *
   * The retry condition is controlled by the `retryWith` bi-function. On a successful response, this function is
   * passed the response as the first argument. On a failed response, the exception is passed as the second argument.
   * The other respective argument is passed a null. `retryWith` should return one or more requests to be retried.
   *
   * If a successful response is issued a retry, the response is still propagated downstream.
   *
   * The implementation of the RetryFlow assumes that `flow` follows one-in-one-out element semantics.
   *
   * The `flow` and `retryWith` take an additional `State` parameter which can be used to correlate a request
   * with a response.

/**
 * Stream cipher support based upon JSSE.
 *
 * The underlying SSLEngine has four ports: plaintext input/output and
 * ciphertext input/output. These are modeled as a [[akka.stream.BidiShape]]
 * element for use in stream topologies, where the plaintext ports are on the
 * left hand side of the shape and the ciphertext ports on the right hand side.
 *
 * Configuring JSSE is a rather complex topic, please refer to the JDK platform
 * documentation or the excellent user guide that is part of the Play Framework
 * documentation. The philosophy of this integration into Akka Streams is to
 * expose all knobs and dials to client code and therefore not limit the
 * configuration possibilities. In particular the client code will have to
 * provide the SSLEngine, which is typically created from a SSLContext. Handshake
 * parameters and other parameters are defined when creating the SSLEngine.
 *
 * '''IMPORTANT NOTE'''
 *
 * The TLS specification until version 1.2 did not permit half-closing of the user data session
 * that it transports—to be precise a half-close will always promptly lead to a
 * full close. This means that canceling the plaintext output or completing the
 * plaintext input of the SslTls operator will lead to full termination of the
 * secure connection without regard to whether bytes are remaining to be sent or
 * received, respectively. Especially for a client the common idiom of attaching
 * a finite Source to the plaintext input and transforming the plaintext response
 * bytes coming out will not work out of the box due to early termination of the
 * connection. For this reason there is a parameter that determines whether the
 * SslTls operator shall ignore completion and/or cancellation events, and the
 * default is to ignore completion (in view of the client–server scenario). In
 * order to terminate the connection the client will then need to cancel the
 * plaintext output as soon as all expected bytes have been received. When
 * ignoring both types of events the operator will shut down once both events have
 * been received. See also [[TLSClosing]]. For now, half-closing is also not
 * supported with TLS 1.3 where the spec allows it.

   *  WARNING: Be aware that throttle is using scheduler to slow down the stream. This scheduler has minimal time of triggering
   *  next push. Consequently it will slow down the stream as it has minimal pause for emitting. This can happen in
   *  case burst is 0 and speed is higher than 30 events per second. You need to increase the `maximumBurst`  if
   *  elements arrive with small interval (30 milliseconds or less). Use the overloaded `throttle` method without
   *  `maximumBurst` parameter to automatically calculate the `maximumBurst` based on the given rate (`cost/per`).
   *  In other words the throttler always enforces the rate limit when `maximumBurst` parameter is given, but in
   *  certain cases (mostly due to limited scheduler resolution) it enforces a tighter bound than what was prescribed.

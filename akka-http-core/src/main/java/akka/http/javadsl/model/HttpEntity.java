/**
 * Represents the entity of an Http message. An entity consists of the content-type of the data
 * and the actual data itself. Some subtypes of HttpEntity also define the content-length of the
 * data.
 *
 * An HttpEntity can be of several kinds:
 *
 *  - HttpEntity.Empty: the statically known empty entity
 *  - HttpEntity.Strict: an entity containing already evaluated ByteString data
 *  - HttpEntity.Default: the default entity which has a known length and which contains
 *                       a stream of ByteStrings.
 *  - HttpEntity.Chunked: represents an entity that is delivered using `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`
 *  - HttpEntity.CloseDelimited: an entity which doesn't have a fixed length but which is delimited by
 *                              closing the connection.
 *  - HttpEntity.IndefiniteLength: an entity which doesn't have a fixed length which can be used to construct BodyParts
 *                                with indefinite length
 *
 *  Marker-interfaces denote which subclasses can be used in which context:
 *  - RequestEntity: an entity type that can be used in an HttpRequest
 *  - ResponseEntity: an entity type that can be used in an HttpResponse
 *  - BodyPartEntity: an entity type that can be used in a BodyPart
 *  - UniversalEntity: an entity type that can be used in every context
 *
 * Use the static constructors in HttpEntities to construct instances.

   *   produced rule is immediately executed.
   *
   * - a function with 1 to 5 parameters these parameters are mapped against the top of the value stack, popped
   *   and the function executed. Thereby the function behaves just like an action function for the `~>` operator,
   *   i.e. if it produces a Unit value this result is simply dropped. HList results are pushed onto the value stack
   *   (all their elements individually), rule results are immediately executed and other result values are pushed
   *   onto the value stack as a single element.
   *
   * - a function with one HList parameter the behavior is similar to the previous case with the difference that the
   *   elements of this parameter HList are mapped against the value stack top. This allows for consumption of an
   *   arbitrary number of value stack elements. (Note: This feature of ``run`` is not yet currently implemented.)
   *
   * - any other value the result type of `run` is an always succeeding `Rule0`.
   *
   * NOTE: Even though the block is not a call-by-name parameter it will be executed
   * for every rule application anew! (Since the expression is directly transplanted
   * into the rule method by the `rule` macro.

 * API May Change: Implement this interface and use it in [[DurableStateBehavior#withChangeEventHandler]]

 *
 * The `updateHandler` and `deleteHandler` are invoked after the ordinary command handler. Be aware of that
 * if the state is mutable and modified by the command handler the previous state parameter of the `updateHandler`
 * will also include the modification, since it's the same instance. If that is a problem you need to use
 * immutable state and create a new state instance when modifying it in the command handler.

 * Facility to convert from and to specialised data models, as may be required by specialized persistence Journals.
 * Typical use cases include (but are not limited to):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>extracting events from "envelopes"</li>
 *   <li>adapting events from a "domain model" to the "data model", e.g. converting to the Journals storage format,
 *       such as JSON, BSON or any specialised binary format</li>
 *   <li>adapting events from a "data model" to the "domain model"</li>
 *   <li>adding metadata that is understood by the journal</li>
 *   <li>migration by splitting up events into sequences of other events</li>
 *   <li>migration filtering out unused events, or replacing an event with another</li>
 * </ul>

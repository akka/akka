/**
 * The Agent class was inspired by agents in Clojure.
 *
 * Agents provide asynchronous change of individual locations. Agents
 * are bound to a single storage location for their lifetime, and only
 * allow mutation of that location (to a new state) to occur as a result
 * of an action. Update actions are functions that are asynchronously
 * applied to the Agent's state and whose return value becomes the
 * Agent's new state. The state of an Agent should be immutable.
 *
 * While updates to Agents are asynchronous, the state of an Agent is
 * always immediately available for reading by any thread (using ''get''
 * or ''apply'') without any messages.
 *
 * Agents are reactive. The update actions of all Agents get interleaved
 * amongst threads in a thread pool. At any point in time, at most one
 * ''send'' action for each Agent is being executed. Actions dispatched to
 * an agent from another thread will occur in the order they were sent,
 * potentially interleaved with actions dispatched to the same agent from
 * other sources.
 *
 * If an Agent is used within an enclosing transaction, then it will
 * participate in that transaction. Agents are integrated with the STM -
 * any dispatches made in a transaction are held until that transaction
 * commits, and are discarded if it is retried or aborted.
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * Example of usage:
 * {{{
 * val agent = Agent(5)
 *
 * agent send (_ * 2)
 *
 * ...
 *
 * val result = agent()
 * // use result ...
 *
 * agent.close
 * }}}
 * <br/>
 *
 * Agent is also monadic, which means that you can compose operations using
 * for-comprehensions. In monadic usage the original agents are not touched
 * but new agents are created. So the old values (agents) are still available
 * as-is. They are so-called 'persistent'.
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * Example of monadic usage:
 * {{{
 * val agent1 = Agent(3)
 * val agent2 = Agent(5)
 *
 * for (value <- agent1) {
 *   result = value + 1
 * }
 *
 * val agent3 = for (value <- agent1) yield value + 1
 *
 * val agent4 = for {
 *   value1 <- agent1
 *   value2 <- agent2
 * } yield value1 + value2
 *
 * agent1.close
 * agent2.close
 * agent3.close
 * agent4.close
 * }}}

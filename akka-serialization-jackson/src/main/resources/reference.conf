  # disabling this is to remove extraneous type information (ie, fully qualified class names) when
  # serialized objects are persisted in Akka persistence or replicated using Akka distributed

  # use this include when changing serializers, so you don't want this serializer used for
  # serialization and you haven't declared any bindings for it, but you still want to be able to

  # you only want some sub types of a given Jackson polymorphic type to be serialized using this

  # @JsonTypeInfo annotation) to store type information in the JSON itself. The intention behind
  # disabling this is to remove extraneous type information (ie, fully qualified class names) when
  # serialized objects are persisted in Akka persistence or replicated using Akka distributed

  # use this include when changing serializers, so you don't want this serializer used for
  # serialization and you haven't declared any bindings for it, but you still want to be able to
  # deserialize messages that were serialized with this serializer, as well as situations where
  # you only want some sub types of a given Jackson polymorphic type to be serialized using this

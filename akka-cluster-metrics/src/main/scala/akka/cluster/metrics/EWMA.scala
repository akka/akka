/**
 * The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) approach captures short-term
 * movements in volatility for a conditional volatility forecasting model. By virtue
 * of its alpha, or decay factor, this provides a statistical streaming data model
 * that is exponentially biased towards newer entries.
 *
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average
 *
 * An EWMA only needs the most recent forecast value to be kept, as opposed to a standard
 * moving average model.
 *
 * @param alpha decay factor, sets how quickly the exponential weighting decays for past data compared to new data,
 *   see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average
 *
 * @param value the current exponentially weighted moving average, e.g. Y(n - 1), or,
 *             the sampled value resulting from the previous smoothing iteration.
 *             This value is always used as the previous EWMA to calculate the new EWMA.

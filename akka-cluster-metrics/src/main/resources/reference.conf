# Akka Cluster Metrics Reference Config File #

# This is the reference config file that contains all the default settings.
# Make your edits in your application.conf in order to override these settings.

# Sigar provisioning:
#
#  User can provision sigar classes and native library in one of the following ways:
# 
#  1) Use https://github.com/kamon-io/sigar-loader Kamon sigar-loader as a project dependency for the user project.
#  Metrics extension will extract and load sigar library on demand with help of Kamon sigar provisioner.
# 
#  2) Use https://github.com/kamon-io/sigar-loader Kamon sigar-loader as java agent: `java -javaagent:/path/to/sigar-loader.jar`
#  Kamon sigar loader agent will extract and load sigar library during JVM start.
# 
#  3) Place `sigar.jar` on the `classpath` and sigar native library for the o/s on the `java.library.path`
#  User is required to manage both project dependency and library deployment manually.

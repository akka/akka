/**
 * A [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler]] that uses a timer to control the message delivery rate.
 *
 * ==Example==
 * For example, if you set a rate like "3 messages in 1 second", the throttler
 * will send the first three messages immediately to the target actor but will need to impose a delay before
 * sending out further messages:
 * {{{
 *   // A simple actor that prints whatever it receives
 *   val printer = system.actorOf(Props(new Actor {
 *     def receive = {
 *       case x => println(x)
 *     }
 *   }))
 *   // The throttler for this example, setting the rate
 *   val throttler = system.actorOf(Props(new TimerBasedThrottler(3 msgsPer (1.second))))
 *   // Set the target
 *   throttler ! SetTarget(Some(printer))
 *   // These three messages will be sent to the printer immediately
 *   throttler ! "1"
 *   throttler ! "2"
 *   throttler ! "3"
 *   // These two will wait at least until 1 second has passed
 *   throttler ! "4"
 *   throttler ! "5"
 * }}}
 *
 * ==Implementation notes==
 * This throttler implementation installs a timer that repeats every `rate.durationInMillis` and enables `rate.numberOfCalls`
 * additional calls to take place. A [[akka.pattern.throttle.TimerBasedThrottler]] uses very few system resources, provided the rate's duration is not too
 * fine-grained (which would cause a lot of timer invocations); for example, it does not store the calling history
 * as other throttlers may need to do.
 *
 * However, a [[akka.pattern.throttle.TimerBasedThrottler]] only provides ''weak guarantees'' on the rate:
 *
 *  - Only ''delivery'' times are taken into account: if, for example, the throttler is used to throttle
 *    requests to an external web service then only the start times of the web requests are considered.
 *    If a web request takes very long on the server then more than `rate.numberOfCalls`-many requests
 *    may be observed on the server in an interval of duration `rate.durationInMillis()`.
 *  - There may be intervals of duration `rate.durationInMillis()` that contain more than `rate.numberOfCalls`
 *    message deliveries: a [[akka.pattern.throttle.TimerBasedThrottler]] only makes guarantees for the intervals
 *    of its ''own'' timer, namely that no more than `rate.numberOfCalls`-many messages are delivered within such intervals. Other intervals on the
 *    timeline may contain more calls.
 *
 * For some applications, these guarantees may not be sufficient.
 *
 * ==Known issues==
 *
 *  - If you change the rate using `SetRate(rate)`, the actual rate may in fact be higher for the
 *    overlapping period (i.e., `durationInMillis()`) of the new and old rate. Therefore,
 *    changing the rate frequently is not recommended with the current implementation.
 *  - The queue of messages to be delivered is not persisted in any way; actor or system failure will
 *    cause the queued messages to be lost.
 *

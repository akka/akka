/**
 * Marker trait for throttlers.
 *
 * == Throttling ==
 * A [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler]] understands actor messages of type
 * [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler.SetTarget]], [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler.SetRate]], in
 * addition to any other messages, which the throttler will consider as messages to be sent to
 * the target.
 *
 * A <em>throttler</em> is an actor that is defined through a <em>target actor</em> and a <em>rate</em>
 * (of type [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler.Rate]]). You set or change the target and rate at any time through the `SetTarget(target)`
 * and `SetRate(rate)` messages, respectively. When you send the throttler any other message `msg`, it will
 * put the message `msg` into an internal queue and eventually send all queued messages to the target, at
 * a speed that respects the given rate. If no target is currently defined then the messages will be queued
 * and will be delivered as soon as a target gets set.
 *
 * == Transparency ==
 * Notice that the throttler `forward`s messages, i.e., the target will see the original message sender (and not the throttler) as the sender of the message.
 *
 * == Persistence ==
 * Throttlers usually use an internal queue to keep the messages that need to be sent to the target.
 * You therefore cannot rely on the throttler's inbox size in order to learn how much messages are
 * outstanding.
 *
 * It is left to the implementation whether the internal queue is persisted over application restarts or
 * actor failure.
 *
 * == Processing messages ==
 * The target should process messages as fast as possible. If the target requires substantial time to
 * process messages, it should distribute its work to other actors (using for example something like
 * a [[akka.dispatch.BalancingDispatcher]]), otherwise the resulting system will always work <em>below</em>
 * the threshold rate.
 *
 * <em>Example:</em> Suppose the throttler has a rate of 3msg/s and the target requires 1s to process a message.
 * This system will only process messages at a rate of 1msg/s: the target will receive messages at at most 3msg/s
 * but as it handles them synchronously and each of them takes 1s, its inbox will grow and grow and it will lag more and more behind. In such
 * a situation, the target should <em>distribute</em> its messages to a set of worker actors so that individual messages
 * can be handled in parallel.
 *

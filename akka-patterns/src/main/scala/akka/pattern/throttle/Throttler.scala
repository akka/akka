/**
 * Marker trait for throttlers.
 *
 * A [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler]] understands actor messages of type
 * [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler.SetTarget]], [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler.SetRate]], and
 * [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler.Queue]].
 *
 * A <em>throttler</em> is an actor that is defined through a <em>target actor</em> and a <em>rate</em>
 * (of type [[akka.pattern.throttle.Throttler.Rate]]). You set or change the target and rate at any time through the `SetTarget(target)`
 * and `SetRate(rate)` messages, respectively. When you send the throttler a message `Queue(msg)`, it will
 * put the message `msg` into an internal queue and eventually send all queued messages to the target, at
 * a speed that respects the given rate. If no target is currently defined then the messages will be queued
 * and will be delivered as soon as a target gets set.
 *
 * Notice that the throttler `forward`s messages, i.e., the target will see the original sender of the message
 * (and not the throttler) as the message's sender.
 *
 * It is left to the implementation whether the internal queue is persisted over application restarts or
 * actor failure.
 *

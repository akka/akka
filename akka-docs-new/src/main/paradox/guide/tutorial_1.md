# Your second Akka application, part 1: Top-level architecture

In this and the following chapters we will build a sample Akka application to introduce you to the language of
actors and how problems can be formulated with them. It is a common hurdle for beginners to translate their problem
into actors even though they understand what they do on the high-level. We will build here the core logic of a small
application and guide you through common patterns that help you kickstart your projects with Akka.

The application we aim to write will be a (simplified) IoT system where devices can report temperature data coming
from sensors installed at the homes of users. Users will be able to query the current state of these sensors. To keep
things simple, we will not actually expose the application via HTTP or (other external API), we will concentrate only to the
core logic. On the other hand, we will write tests for the pieces of the application to get you comfortable and 
proficient with testing actors very early.

## Our goals for the IoT system

We will build a simple IoT application with the bare essentials to demonstrate designing an Akka based system. The 
application will consist of two main components:

 * **Device data collection:** This component has the responsibility to maintain a local representation of the
   otherwise remote devices. The devices will be organized into device groups, grouping together sensors belonging
   to a home.
 * **User dashboards:** This component has the responsibility to periodically collect data from the devices for a
   logged in user and present the results as a report.
   
For simplicity, we will only collect temperature data for the devices, but in a real application our local representations
for a remote device (which we will model as an actor) would have many more responsibilities. Among others: reading the
configuration of the device, changing the configuration, checking if the devices are unresponsive, etc. We leave
these complexities for now as they can be easily added as an exercise.

We will also not address the means by which the remote devices communicate with the local representations (actors). Instead
we just build an actor based API which such a network protocol could use. We will use tests for our API everywhere though.

The architecture of the application will look like this:

## Top level architecture

When writing prose, the hardest part is usually to write the first couple of sentences. There is a similar feeling
when you try to build your Akka system: what should be the first actor? Where should it live, what should it do?
Fortunately, unlike with prose, there are established best practices that guide you through these initial steps.

When one creates an actor in Akka it always belongs to a certain parent. This means that actors are always organized
into a tree. In general, creating an actor can only happen from inside another actor. This creator actor becomes the
_parent_ of the newly created _child_ actor. You might ask then, who is the parent of the _first_ actor you create?
As we have seen in the previous chapters, to create a top-level actor one must call `context.actorOf()`. This does
not create a "freestanding" actor though, instead, it injects the corresponding actor as a child into an already
existing tree:

![box diagram of the architecture](diagrams/actor_top_tree.png)

As you see, creating actors from the "top" injects those actors under the path `/user/`, so for example creating
an actor named `myActor` will end up having the path `/user/myActor`. In fact, there are three already existing
actors in the system:

 - `/` the so called _root guardian_. This is the parent of all actors in the system, and the last one to stop
   when the system itself is terminated.
 - `/user` the _guardian_. **This is the parent actor for all user created actors**. The name `user` should not confuse
   you, it has nothing to do with the logged in user, nor user handling in general. This name really means _userspace_
   as this is the place where actors that do not access Akka internals live, i.e. all the actors created by users
   of the Akka library. Every actor you will create will have the constant path `/user/` prepended to it.
 - `/system` the _system guardian_. 
   
The names of these built-in actors contain _guardian_ because these are _supervising_ every actor living as a child
of them (i.e. under their path). We will explain supervision in more detail, all you need to know now that every
unhandled failure from actors bubble up to their parent that, in turn, can decide how to handle this failure. These
predefined actors are guardians in the sense that they are the final lines of defense, where all unhandled failures
from user (or system) actors end up.

> Does the root guardian (the root path `/`) have a parent? As it turns out, it has. This special entity is called
> the "Bubble-Walker". This special entity is invisible for the user and only has uses internally.

### Structure of an ActorRef and paths of actors

The easiest way to see this in action is to simply print `ActorRef` instances. In this small experiment, we print
the reference of the first actor we create and then we create a child of this actor, and print its reference. We have
already created actors with `system.actorOf()`, which creates an actor under `/user` directly. We call these kind
of actors _top level_, even though in practice they are not on the top of the hierarchy, only on the top of the
_user defined_ hierarchy. Since in practice we usually concern ourselves about actors under `/user` this is still a
convenient terminology, and we will stick to it.

Creating a non-top-level actor is possible from any actor, by invoking `context.actorOf()` which has the exact same
signature as its top-level counterpart. This is how it looks like in practice:

@@snip [Hello.scala](../../../test/scala/tutorial_1/ActorHierarchyExperiments.scala) { #print-refs }

We see that the following two lines are printed

```
Actor[akka://testSystem/user/first-actor#1053618476]
Actor[akka://testSystem/user/first-actor/second-actor#-1544706041]
```

First, we notice that all of the paths start with `akka://testSystem/`. Since all actor references are valid URLs, there
is a protocol field needed, which is `akka://` in the case of actors. Then, just like on the World Wide Web, the system
is identified. In our case this is `testSystem`, but could be any other name (if remote communications between multiple
systems is enabled this name is the hostname of the system so other systems can find it on the network). Our two actors, 
as we have discussed before, live under user, and form a hierarchy:

 * `akka://testSystem/user/first-actor` is the first actor we created, which lives directly under the user guardian,
   `/user`
 * `akka://testSystem/user/first-actor/second-actor` is the second actor we created, using `context.actorOf`. As we
   see it lives directly under the first actor. 
   
The last part of the actor reference, like `#1053618476` is a unique identifier of the actor living under the path. 
This is usually not something the user needs to be concerned with, and we leave the discussion of this field for later.

### Hierarchy and lifecycle of actors

We have so far seen that actors are organized into a **strict hierarchy**. This hierarchy consists of a predefined
upper layer of three actors (the root guardian, the user guardian and the system guardian), then the user created
top-level actors (those directly living under `/user`) and the children of those. We understand now how the hierarchy
looks like, but there is the nagging question left: _Why do we need this hierarchy? What is it used for?_

The first use of the hierarchy is to manage the lifecycle of actors. Actors pop into existence when created, then later,
when the user requests, they are stopped. Whenever an actor is stopped, all of its children are _recursively stopped_,
too. This is a very useful property and greatly simplifies cleaning up resources and avoiding resource leaks (like open
sockets files, etc.). In fact, one of the overlooked difficulties when dealing with low-level multi-threaded code is
the management of the lifecycle of various concurrent resources.

Stopping an actor can be done by the call `context.stop(actorRef)`. **It is considered a bad practice to stop arbitrary
actors this way**. The recommended pattern is to call `context.stop(self)` inside an actor to stop itself, usually as
a response to some user defined stop message or when the actor is done with its job.
 
The actor API exposes many lifecycle hooks that the actor implementation can override. The most commonly used are
`preStart()` and `postStop()`.

 * `preStart()` is invoked after the actor has started but before it processes its first message.
 * `postStop()` is invoked just before the actor stops. No messages are processed after this point.
 
Again, we can try out all this with a simple experiment:
 
@@snip [Hello.scala](../../../test/scala/tutorial_1/ActorHierarchyExperiments.scala) { #start-stop }

After running it, we get the output

```
first started
second started
second stopped
first stopped
```

We see that once we stopped the first actor, it recursively stopped our second actor, too, then it finished itself.
This ordering is strict, all `postStop()` hooks of the children are called before the `postStop()` hook of the parent
is called.
 
The family of these lifecycle hooks is rich, and we recommend reading the actor lifecycle (TODO: reference-doc) section
of the reference for all the details.

### Hierarchy and failure handling (Supervision)

Parents and children are not only connected by their lifecycles. Whenever an actor fails (throws an exception or
an unhandled exception bubbles out from `receive`) it is temporarily suspended. The failure information is propagated
then to the parent, which can decide what to do with the child actor now. The default _supervisor strategy_ is to
stop and restart the child. If you don't change the default strategy all failures result in a restart. We won't change
the default for now in this simple experiment:

@@snip [Hello.scala](../../../test/scala/tutorial_1/ActorHierarchyExperiments.scala) { #supervise }

After running the snippet, we see the following output on the console:

```
supervised actor started
supervised actor fails now
supervised actor stopped
supervised actor started
[ERROR] [03/29/2017 10:47:14.150] [testSystem-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-2] [akka://testSystem/user/supervising-actor/supervised-actor] I failed!

        at akka.dispatch.forkjoin.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:107)
```

We see that after failure the actor is stopped and immediately started again. We also see a log entry reporting the
exception that was handled, in this case our test exception. We only used here `preStart()` and `postStop()` hooks
which are the default to be called after and before restarts, so we cannot distinguish from inside the actor if it
was started for the first time or restarted. This is usually the right thing to do, the purpose of the restart is to
set the actor in a known-good state, which usually means a clean starting stage. What actually happens though is
that **the preRestart()` and `postRestart()` methods are called which, if not overridden, by default delegate to
`postStop()` and `preStart()` respectively**. You can experiment with overriding these additional methods and see
how the output changes.

For the impatient, we also recommend looking into the supervision reference page (TODO: reference) for more in-depth
details.

### The first actor

Actors are organized into a strict tree, where the lifecycle of every child is tied to the parent and where parents
are responsible to decide on the fate of failed children. At first, it might not be evident how to map our problem
to such a tree, but in practice, this is easier than it looks. All we need to do is to rewrite our architecture diagram
that contained nested boxes into a tree:

![actor tree diagram of the architecture](diagrams/arch_tree_diagram.png)

In simple terms, every component manages the lifecycle of the subcomponents. No subcomponent can outlive the parent
component. This is exactly how the actor hierarchy works. Also, it is desirable that a component handles the failure
of its subcomponents unless the failure leads to the failure of the whole component. Together, these two desirable
properties lead to the conclusion that the "contained-in" relationship of components should be mapped to the 
"children-of" relationship of actors.

The only question left is how to map the top-level components to actors. It might be tempting to create the actors
representing the main components as top-level actors. We instead, recommend creating an explicit component that
represent the whole application. In other words, we will have a single top-level actor in our actor system and have
the main components as children of this actor.

The first actor happens to be rather simple now, as we have not implemented any of the components yet. What is new
is that we have dropped using `println()` and use instead the `ActorLogging` helper trait which allow us to use the
logging facility built into Akka directly: 

@@snip [Hello.scala](../../../test/scala/tutorial_1/IotSupervisor.scala) { #iot-supervisor }

All we need now is to tie this up with a class with the `main` entry point:

@@snip [Hello.scala](../../../test/scala/tutorial_1/IotApp.scala) { #iot-app }

This application does very little for now, but we have the first actor in place and we are ready to extend it further.

## What is next?

In the following chapters we will grow the application step-by-step:
 
 1. We will create the representation for a device
 2. We create the device management component
 3. We add query capabilities to device groups
 4. We add the dashboard component

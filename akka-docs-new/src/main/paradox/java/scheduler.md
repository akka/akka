# Scheduler

Sometimes the need for making things happen in the future arises, and where do
you go look then?  Look no further than `ActorSystem`! There you find the
`scheduler` method that returns an instance of
`akka.actor.Scheduler`, this instance is unique per ActorSystem and is
used internally for scheduling things to happen at specific points in time.

You can schedule sending of messages to actors and execution of tasks
(functions or Runnable).  You will get a `Cancellable` back that you can call
`cancel` on to cancel the execution of the scheduled operation.

> **Warning:**
The default implementation of `Scheduler` used by Akka is based on job
buckets which are emptied according to a fixed schedule.  It does not
execute tasks at the exact time, but on every tick, it will run everything
that is (over)due.  The accuracy of the default Scheduler can be modified
by the `akka.scheduler.tick-duration` configuration property.

## Some examples

Schedule to send the "foo"-message to the testActor after 50ms:

@@snip [SchedulerDocTest.java](code/docs/actor/SchedulerDocTest.java) { #imports1 }

@@snip [SchedulerDocTest.java](code/docs/actor/SchedulerDocTest.java) { #schedule-one-off-message }

Schedule a Runnable, that sends the current time to the testActor, to be executed after 50ms:

@@snip [SchedulerDocTest.java](code/docs/actor/SchedulerDocTest.java) { #schedule-one-off-thunk }

> **Warning:**
If you schedule Runnable instances you should be extra careful
to not pass or close over unstable references. In practice this means that you should
not call methods on the enclosing Actor from within the Runnable.
If you need to schedule an invocation it is better to use the `schedule()`
variant accepting a message and an `ActorRef` to schedule a message to self
(containing the necessary parameters) and then call the method when the message is received.

Schedule to send the "Tick"-message to the `tickActor` after 0ms repeating every 50ms:

@@snip [SchedulerDocTest.java](code/docs/actor/SchedulerDocTest.java) { #imports1 #imports2 }

@@snip [SchedulerDocTest.java](code/docs/actor/SchedulerDocTest.java) { #schedule-recurring }

## From `akka.actor.ActorSystem`

@@snip [ActorSystem.scala](../../../../../akka-actor/src/main/scala/akka/actor/ActorSystem.scala) { #scheduler }

> **Warning:**
All scheduled task will be executed when the `ActorSystem` is terminated, i.e.
the task may execute before its timeout.

## The Scheduler Interface for Implementors

The actual scheduler implementation is loaded reflectively upon
`ActorSystem` start-up, which means that it is possible to provide a
different one using the `akka.scheduler.implementation` configuration
property. The referenced class must implement the following interface:

@@snip [AbstractScheduler.java](../../../../../akka-actor/src/main/java/akka/actor/AbstractScheduler.java) { #scheduler }

## The Cancellable interface

Scheduling a task will result in a `Cancellable` (or throw an
`IllegalStateException` if attempted after the schedulerï¿½s shutdown).
This allows you to cancel something that has been scheduled for execution.

> **Warning:**
This does not abort the execution of the task, if it had already been
started.  Check the return value of `cancel` to detect whether the
scheduled task was canceled or will (eventually) have run.

/**
 * INTERNAL API
 *
 * Immutable data structure that holds the reachability status of subject nodes as seen
 * from observer nodes. Failure detector for the subject nodes exist on the
 * observer nodes. Changes (reachable, unreachable, terminated) are only performed
 * by observer nodes to its own records. Each change bumps the version number of the
 * record, and thereby it is always possible to determine which record is newest when
 * merging two instances.
 *
 * By default, each observer treats every other node as reachable. That allows to
 * introduce the invariant that if an observer sees all nodes as reachable, no
 * records should be kept at all. Therefore, in a running cluster with full
 * reachability, no records need to be kept at all.
 *
 * Aggregated status of a subject node is defined as (in this order):
 * - Terminated if any observer node considers it as Terminated
 * - Unreachable if any observer node considers it as Unreachable
 * - Reachable otherwise, i.e. no observer node considers it as Unreachable

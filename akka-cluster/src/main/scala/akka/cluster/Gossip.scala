/**
 * INTERNAL API
 *
 * Represents the state of the cluster; cluster ring membership, ring convergence -
 * all versioned by a vector clock.
 *
 * When a node is joining the `Member`, with status `Joining`, is added to `members`.
 * If the joining node was downed it is moved from `overview.unreachable` (status `Down`)
 * to `members` (status `Joining`). It cannot rejoin if not first downed.
 *
 * When convergence is reached the leader change status of `members` from `Joining`
 * to `Up`.
 *
 * When failure detector consider a node as unavailable it will be moved from
 * `members` to `overview.unreachable`.
 *
 * When a node is downed, either manually or automatically, its status is changed to `Down`.
 * It is also removed from `overview.seen` table. The node will reside as `Down` in the
 * `overview.unreachable` set until joining again and it will then go through the normal
 * joining procedure.
 *
 * When a `Gossip` is received the version (vector clock) is used to determine if the
 * received `Gossip` is newer or older than the current local `Gossip`. The received `Gossip`
 * and local `Gossip` is merged in case of conflicting version, i.e. vector clocks without
 * same history.
 *
 * When a node is told by the user to leave the cluster the leader will move it to `Leaving`
 * and then rebalance and repartition the cluster and start hand-off by migrating the actors
 * from the leaving node to the new partitions. Once this process is complete the leader will
 * move the node to the `Exiting` state and once a convergence is complete move the node to
 * `Removed` by removing it from the `members` set and sending a `Removed` command to the
 * removed node telling it to shut itself down.
